Once upon a time, a man (whom we\'ll call Mike) stumbled upon an armed robbery in a hardware store. The robber rummaged around the cluttered store brandishing a silver weapon; finally, he stole all the money.

The police were summoned immediately, but before they arrived, Mike talked to another customer about the robbery. We\'ll call her Maria.

The police arrived, and when they questioned Mike, he recounted the robbery at some length: He described in detail the silver weapon, the money, and the calculator. When the police asked him about a tool that they heard had been taken, "Did you see if it was a hammer or a screwdriver?", he said, "Screwdriver." How did it happen that an ordinary upstanding guy like Mike came to remember seeing a screwdriver? (a) He might never have seen the hammer in the first place, and he mentioned the screwdriver because he remembered hearing about it. (b) He could have remembered both the hammer and the screwdriver, but he mentioned the screwdriver when asked because he trusted Maria\'s memory more than he trusted his own. (c) He could have failed to see the hammer and failed to hear Maria mention the screwdriver, and he simply guessed about the tool when asked by the police.

On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of \\fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users\' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets.

Stepwise discriminant function was used to define the profile of neuropsychologic functioning across domains. The neuropsychologic profile in these autistic individuals was defined by impairments in skilled motor, complex memory, complex language, and reasoning domains, and by intact or superior performance in the attention, simple memory, simple language, and visual–spatial domains. This profile is not consistent with mental retardation or with a general deficit syndrome, but rather with a selective impairment in complex information processing that does not involve visual–spatial processing. This profile is not consistent with a single primary deficit, but with a multiple primary deficit model in which the deficit pattern within and across domains is reflective of the complexity of the information processing demands. This neuropsychologic profile is furthermore consistent with the neurophysiologic characterization of autism as a late information processing disorder with sparing of early information processing.

METHOD: Fifty-two subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia were administered tests of information processing and thought disorder. The information-processing tests included visual backward masking and prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex. Thought disorder was measured with the Magical Ideation Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms, the alogia subscale of the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms, and the Ego Impairment Index-human experience variable and its subcomponents derived from the Rorschach. RESULTS: Elevated poor responses on the Ego Impairment Index-human experience variable were significantly correlated with information-processing deficits. In a simultaneous multiple regression, the auditory prepulse inhibition measure was the best predictor of poor responses on the Ego Impairment Index-human experience variable. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a correlative relationship between information-processing deficits and thought disorder. The relationship is most apparent when highly sensitive measures of both information processing and thought disorder are used. Furthermore, the prediction of poor responses on the Ego Impairment Index-human experience variable by auditory prepulse inhibition is important, since the neural circuitry of prepulse inhibition is known and involves the modulatory influences of the cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that information-processing failures are associated with cognitive fragmentation and thought disorder. More speculatively, these results allow us to hypothesize that impairments in part of the cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit may lead to thought disorder, as well as prepulse inhibition deficits.', 0.0, 1, 0.0, 2.17054237016082e-05), (2410465342, 'Automatic deception detection: methods for finding fake news', 'Niall J.

The diet claims to be effective at producing weight loss despite ad-libitum consumption of fatty meat, butter, and other high-fat dairy products, restricting only the intake of carbohydrates to under 30 g a day. Low-carbohydrate diets have been regarded as fad diets, but recent research questions this view. Starting point A systematic review of low-carbohydrate diets found that the weight loss achieved is associated with the duration of the diet and restriction of energy intake, but not with restriction of carbohydrates. Two groups have reported longer-term randomised studies that compared instruction in the low-carbohydrate diet with a low-fat calorie-reduced diet in obese patients ( N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 2082–90; Ann Intern Med 2004; 140: 778–85). Both trials showed better weight loss on the low-carbohydrate diet after 6 months, but no difference after 12 months. Where next? The apparent paradox that ad-libitum intake of high-fat foods produces weight loss might be due to severe restriction of carbohydrate depleting glycogen stores, leading to excretion of bound water, the ketogenic nature of the diet being appetite suppressing, the high protein-content being highly satiating and reducing spontaneous food intake, or limited food choices leading to decreased energy intake. Long-term studies are needed to measure changes in nutritional status and body composition during the low-carbohydrate diet, and to assess fasting and postprandial cardiovascular risk factors and adverse effects.

Such misinformation has the potential of affecting public opinion, providing an opportunity for malicious parties to manipulate the outcomes of public events such as elections. Because such high stakes are at play, automatically detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging problem that is not yet well understood. Nevertheless, there are three generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text of an article, the user response it receives, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has largely focused on tailoring solutions to one particular characteristic which has limited their success and generality. In this work, we propose a model that combines all three characteristics for a more accurate and automated prediction. Specifically, we incorporate the behavior of both parties, users and articles, and the group behavior of users who propagate fake news. Motivated by the three characteristics, we propose a model called CSI which is composed of three modules: Capture, Score, and Integrate. The first module is based on the response and text; it uses a Recurrent Neural Network to capture the temporal pattern of user activity on a given article. The second module learns the source characteristic based on the behavior of users, and the two are integrated with the third module to classify an article as fake or not.

This study presented adults and adolescents, with and without ASD, with a complex social scene alongside another, non-social scene, and measured eye-movements during a 3-s viewing period. Analyses first identified viewing time to different regions and then investigated some more complex issues. These were: the location of the very first fixation in a trial (indicating attentional priority); the effect of a task instruction on scan paths; the extent to which gaze-following was evident; and the degree to which participants’ scan paths were influenced by the low-level properties of a scene. Results indicate a superficially normal attentional preference for social information in adults with ASD. However, more sensitive measures show that ASD does entail social attention problems across the lifespan, supporting accounts of the disorder which emphasise lifelong neurodevelopmental atypicalities.

Children (3 to 8 years old) participated in science demonstrations, listened to their parents read a story that described experienced and nonexperienced events, and subsequently discussed the science experience in two follow-up interviews. Many children described fictitious events in response to open-ended prompts, and there were no age differences in suggestibility during this phase of the interview. Accuracy declined markedly in response to direct questions, especially for the younger children. Although the older children retracted many of their false reports after receiving source-monitoring instructions, the younger children did not. Path analyses indicated that acquiescence, free recall, and source monitoring all contribute to mediating patterns of suggestibility across age. Results indicate that judgments about the accuracy of children's testimony must consider the possibility of exposure to misinformation prior to formal interviews. During the past decade, there has been keen interest in young children's performance when interviewed about autobiographical events. This interest was sharpened by broad social changes that led the public to be more concerned about crimes to which child victims are often the sole witnesses (e.g., child sexual abuse), but it also reflected a movement in psychology away from relatively artificial research paradigms (e.g., studies of memory for word lists) and toward more naturalistic and multifaceted approaches to research.

Do we use our reasoning abilities to convince ourselves that statements that align with our ideology are true, or does reasoning allow us to effectively differentiate fake from real regardless of political ideology? Here we test these competing accounts in two studies (total N\u202f=\u202f3446 Mechanical Turk workers) by using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) as a measure of the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning. We find that CRT performance is negatively correlated with the perceived accuracy of fake news, and positively correlated with the ability to discern fake news from real news – even for headlines that align with individuals’ political ideology. Moreover, overall discernment was actually better for ideologically aligned headlines than for misaligned headlines. Finally, a headline-level analysis finds that CRT is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively implausible (primarily fake) headlines, and positively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively plausible (primarily real) headlines. In contrast, the correlation between CRT and perceived accuracy is unrelated to how closely the headline aligns with the participant’s ideology. Thus, we conclude that analytic thinking is used to assess the plausibility of headlines, regardless of whether the stories are consistent or inconsistent with one’s political ideology. Our findings therefore suggest that susceptibility to fake news is driven more by lazy thinking than it is by partisan bias per se – a finding that opens potential avenues for fighting fake news.', 41297.1399085821, 38, 0.0372069317023446, 4.96958777020253e-05), (2296706733, 'Hoaxy: A Platform for Tracking Online Misinformation', 'Chengcheng Shao (National University of Defense Technology), Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia (Indiana University), Alessandro Flammini (Indiana University), Filippo Menczer (Indiana University)', 2016, 239, 'Massive amounts of misinformation have been observed to spread in uncontrolled fashion across social media.

We discuss the design of the platform and present a preliminary analysis of a sample of public tweets containing both fake news and fact checking. We find that, in the aggregate, the sharing of fact-checking content typically lags that of misinformation by 10-20 hours.

A common way to encounter misinformation is through face-to-face interaction, in particular, via conversation with other individuals who also witnessed the crime. The current research compares this kind of misinformation with the non-social post-event narrative method typically employed in laboratory studies.\r\n\r\nMethod. Young (17–33 years) and older (58–80 years) adults viewed a simulated crime event on video and were later exposed to four items of misinformation about it. The misinformation items were either introduced as part of a discussion about the event with a confederate or were embedded within a written narrative about the event that participants were asked to read. A questionnaire containing 20 items about the event was given to participants before and after the experimental manipulation.\r\n\r\nResults. Participants were less accurate than controls on questionnaire items after encountering misinformation. More importantly, misinformation encountered socially was significantly more misleading than misinformation from a non-social source. This was true for both young and older adults.\r\n\r\nConclusion.

Objective To determine whether patients with BDD have abnormal patterns of brain activation when visually processing others' faces with high, low, or normal spatial frequency information. Design Case-control study. Setting University hospital. Participants Twelve right-handed, medication-free subjects with BDD and 13 control subjects matched by age, sex, and educational achievement. Intervention Functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing matching tasks of face stimuli. Stimuli were neutral-expression photographs of others' faces that were unaltered, altered to include only high spatial frequency visual information, or altered to include only low spatial frequency visual information. Main Outcome Measure Blood oxygen level–dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signal changes in the BDD and control groups during tasks with each stimulus type. Results Subjects with BDD showed greater left hemisphere activity relative to controls, particularly in lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal lobe regions for all face tasks (and dorsal anterior cingulate activity for the low spatial frequency task). Controls recruited left-sided prefrontal and dorsal anterior cingulate activity only for the high spatial frequency task. Conclusions Subjects with BDD demonstrate fundamental differences from controls in visually processing others' faces. The predominance of left-sided activity for low spatial frequency and normal faces suggests detail encoding and analysis rather than holistic processing, a pattern evident in controls only for high spatial frequency faces. These abnormalities may be associated with apparent perceptual distortions in patients with BDD.

Our interest was in examining subjects’ production of the misleading postevent information on the second cued recall test (on which they were instructed to ignore the postevent information) as a function of instructions given before the first test. In both experiments, robust misinformation effects occurred, with misrecall being greatest under conditions in which subjects had produced the wrong detail from the narrative on the first test. In this condition subjects were more likely to recall the wrong detail on the second test and were also more likely to say that they remembered its occurrence, when instructed to use Tulving's (1985) remember / know procedure, than in comparison conditions.

One way in which false information may be presented on Wikipedia is in the form of hoax articles, i.e., articles containing fabricated facts about nonexistent entities or events. In this paper we study false information on Wikipedia by focusing on the hoax articles that have been created throughout its history. We make several contributions. First, we assess the real-world impact of hoax articles by measuring how long they survive before being debunked, how many pageviews they receive, and how heavily they are referred to by documents on the Web. We find that, while most hoaxes are detected quickly and have little impact on Wikipedia, a small number of hoaxes survive long and are well cited across the Web. Second, we characterize the nature of successful hoaxes by comparing them to legitimate articles and to failed hoaxes that were discovered shortly after being created. We find characteristic differences in terms of article structure and content, embeddedness into the rest of Wikipedia, and features of the editor who created the hoax. Third, we successfully apply our findings to address a series of classification tasks, most notably to determine whether a given article is a hoax. And finally, we describe and evaluate a task involving humans distinguishing hoaxes from non-hoaxes.

METHODS: Individuals with PTSD (n = 14) and age and sex-matched nontraumatized controls (n = 14) completed an auditory oddball paradigm adapted to functional magnetic resonance imaging at a 1.5-T field strength. RESULTS: Controls displayed bilateral activation in ventral anterior cingulate and amygdala networks, and PTSD subjects showed bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate and amygdala activation to targets relative to nontargets.

The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.', 43110.157873257405, 23, 0.0314814814814815, 4.55975795613485e-05), (2026918925, 'Information processing in post-traumatic stress disorder.', 'S.

The disaster survivors with high levels of PTSD symptomatology evidenced a significantly longer response latency for colour-naming disaster-related words than for other word types. The results of the low-PTSD survivors and non-traumatized controls showed no significant difference between response latencies for general threat words and disaster word, although all 3 groups showed increased latencies for threat words compared with neutral words.

Performance was evaluated on both interference and facilitation components of the task. On the standard version of the task, with equal numbers of color words and neutral words, children with ADHD showed increased Stroop interference (prolongation of color-naming times by color-incongruent stimuli) but normal amounts of facilitation (speeding of color naming by color-congruent stimuli). This finding suggests that children with ADHD show increased disruption of color-naming performance by taskirrelevant information, probably secondary to decreased attentional control over the interference process. In contrast to findings of studies in adults, both groups of children failed to use an attentional strategy to reduce interference when they were administered blocks of trials that varied their expectancy for color word trials.

Thus, misinformation (inaccurate information) and disinformation (deceptive information) diffuse throughout social networks, as misinforming and disinforming are varieties of information behaviour.

Many information behaviour models, however, suggest a normative model of information as true, accurate, complete, despite the ubiquity of misinformation and disinformation. Analysis. Misinformation and disinformation are defined and we show how they extend the concept of information through their informativeness. Table 1 summarizes the features of information, misinformation, and disinformation. Figure 1 illustrates the social diffusion process by which misinforming and disinforming function as types of information behaviour. Conclusion. Misinformation and disinformation are closely linked to information literacy, especially in terms of how they are diffused and shared and how people use both cues to credibility and cues to deception to make judgements.

One-hundred eleven college adults viewed a videotaped mock-crime, received post-event misinformation (or correct information) about the crime, and were subsequently interviewed by a research assistant who built rapport (or did not build rapport) before recalling the mock-crime. Results indicated that rapport-building increased the quality of witness recall by decreasing the percentage of inaccurate and misinformation reported, particularly in response to open-ended questions.

Clinically, patients with panic disorder (PD) have been described as having difficulties in the inhibition of their response to sensory and cognitive events. Because such difficulties may be the result of failures in early stages of information processing, we hypothesized that startle reactivity, PPI and habituation are deficient in unmedicated patients with PD. Moreover, we tested whether there was a relation between startle reflex measures and dysfunctional cognition. Methods: Fourteen unmedicated patients with PD (7 men, 7 women) and 28 healthy comparison subjects (14 men, 14 women) were recruited. Acoustic startle reactivity, habituation and PPI (30-ms, 60-ms, 120-ms, 240-ms and 2000-ms interstimulus intervals) were assessed in the patients with PD and the agematched and sex-matched healthy controls. These data for unmedicated patients with PD were compared with those for 24 medicated patients with PD. Moreover, dysfunctional cognition in patients with PD was measured using the Body Sensations Questionnaire. Results: Unmedicated patients with PD exhibited increased startle reactivity, reduced habituation and significantly reduced PPI in the 30ms, 60-ms, 120-ms and 240-ms prepulse conditions. Furthermore, in unmedicated patients with PD, increased startle response and decreased habituation were correlated significantly with higher cognitive dysfunction scores, but this was not the case for PPI. Conclusions: These data indicate that the early stages of sensory information processing are abnormal in patients with PD in the absence of medication. The observed deficits in PPI and habituation could reflect a more generalized difficulty in suppressing or gating information in PD. The correlation between cognitive symptoms and higher startle response and deficient habituation supports the hypothesis that subjects with PD have abnormalities in the early stages of information processing that lead to a cascade of downstream effects on cognition.', 48.0, 1, 0.00290275761973875, 2.14128125920757e-05), (105589024, 'Position of the American Dietetic Association: food and nutrition misinformation.', 'Brian Wansink (Cornell University)', 2005, 131, 'It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that food and nutrition misinformation can have harmful effects on the health and economic status of consumers. It is the role of nationally credentialed dietetics professionals to advocate for and promote sound, science-based nutrition information to the public, function as primary nutrition educators to health professionals, and actively counter and correct food and nutrition misinformation.In recent years, enormous advances have been made in the science of food and nutrition, leading to a fine-tuning of many recommendations about eating healthfully. Consumers have become increasingly aware of the nutrition-health link, increasingly responsible for changing their own diets, and increasingly reliant on nutrition information to do so. Unfortunately, these same conditions also create opportunities for nutrition misinformation to flourish. News reports rarely provide enough context for consumers to interpret the advice given, and preliminary or idiosyncratic findings often attract unmerited and misleading attention.Effective nutrition communication must be consumer-focused and presented with sufficient context to allow consumers to weigh the information and determine whether it applies to his or her unique needs.

In a dynamic world, information in memory is frequently outdated, corrected, or replaced. People often make use of this misinformation in memory during later reasoning. The example demonstrates several important features of this phenomenon. First, the information and its correction are clearly presented and connected together in memory. Second, the information and its correction are believable, and accepted as valid in the absence of any conflicting information. Third, following correction, the value of the initial information is clearly identified. And further, the misinformation and its correction are both accurately recalled later, at the time of reasoning. The power of misinformation appears to arise from its legitimacy as initially presented. Direct negation of the misinformation, no matter how stated, does not address the initial value of the information as true and relevant, nor explain how the negation may have arisen.', 28164.9179372851, 23, 0.0616216216216216, 3.617962040948479e-05), (2088796307, 'Beliefs, behaviors and HPV vaccine: correcting the myths and the misinformation.', 'Gregory D.

The fake news can take advantage of multimedia content to mislead readers and get dissemination, which can cause negative effects or even manipulate the public events. One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events. Unfortunately, most of the existing approaches can hardly handle this challenge, since they tend to learn event-specific features that can not be transferred to unseen events. In order to address this issue, we propose an end-to-end framework named Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN), which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events. It consists of three main components: the multi-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discriminator. The multi-modal feature extractor is responsible for extracting the textual and visual features from posts. It cooperates with the fake news detector to learn the discriminable representation for the detection of fake news. The role of event discriminator is to remove the event-specific features and keep shared features among events. Extensive experiments are conducted on multimedia datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results show our proposed EANN model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, and learn transferable feature representations.', 7838.12154653054, 47, 0.109189189189189, 5.8907777767871805e-05), (2913081045, 'Fighting misinformation on social media using crowdsourced judgments of news source quality', 'Gordon Pennycook (University of Regina), David G.

We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (“fake news”). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans—mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans—every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd.

We aimed to test both automatic processing of facial affect as well as the integration of auditory and visual emotion cues in individuals with PDD. Methods: In a group of high-functioning adult individuals with PDD and an age- and IQ-matched control group, we measured facial electromyography (EMG) following presentation of visual emotion stimuli (facial expressions) as well as the presentation of audiovisual emotion pairs (faces plus voices). This emotionally driven EMG activity is considered to be a direct correlate of automatic affect processing that is not under intentional control. Results: Our data clearly indicate that among individuals with PDD facial EMG activity is heightened in response to happy and fearful faces, and intact in response to audiovisual affective information. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for enhanced sensitivity to facial cues at the level of reflex-like emotional responses in individuals with PDD.

Indeed, cognitive theories of depression posit that negative biases in the processing of information play a critical role in influencing the onset, maintenance, and recurrence of depressive episodes. In this paper we review findings from behavioral studies documenting that MDD is associated with specific difficulties in attentional disengagement from negatively valenced material, with tendencies to interpret information in a negative manner, with deficits in cognitive control in the processing of negative material, and with enhanced memory for negative material. To gain a better understanding of the neurobiological basis of these abnormalities, we also examine findings from functional neuroimaging studies of depression and show that dysfunction in neural systems that subserve emotion processing, inhibition, and attention may underlie and contribute to the deficits in cognition that have been documented in depressed individuals. Finally, we briefly review evidence from studies of children who are at high familial risk for depression that indicates that abnormalities in cognition and neural function are observable before the onset of MDD and, consequently, may represent a risk factor for the development of this disorder.

However, for many emerging applications like fake news and rumor detection, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features from content.

Exposure to misleading information increased the number of commission errors, particularly when participants were asked about peripheral aspects of the video. At both retention intervals, children were more likely than adults to incorporate the misleading postevent information into their subsequent verbal accounts.

In order to test the effect on end-state functioning of the incorporation of stress management material within a CBT program for PD, 32 people with PD were randomised to either Internet-based CBT (PO1), Internet-based CBT plus stress management (PO2) or an Internet-based information-only control condition (IC).

Community-level prevention and outbreak control measures appear to be dependent on public trust in relevant authorities and information, but little scholarship has explored these issues. We aimed to investigate the role of trust and misinformation on individual preventive behaviours during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Methods We surveyed 961 adults between Sept 1 and Sept 16, 2018. We used a multistage sampling design in Beni and Butembo in North Kivu, DR Congo. Of 412 avenues and cells (the lowest administrative structures; 99 in Beni and 313 in Butembo), we randomly selected 30 in each city. In each avenue or cell, 16 households were selected using the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization's random walk approach. In each household, one adult (aged ≥18 years) was randomly selected for interview. Standardised questionnaires were administered by experienced interviewers. We used multivariate models to examine the intermediate variables of interest, including institutional trust and belief in selected misinformation, with outcomes of interest related to EVD prevention behaviours. Findings Among 961 respondents, 349 (31·9%, 95% CI 27·4–36·9) trusted that local authorities represent their interest. Belief in misinformation was widespread, with 230 (25·5%, 21·7–29·6) respondents believing that the Ebola outbreak was not real. Low institutional trust and belief in misinformation were associated with a decreased likelihood of adopting preventive behaviours, including acceptance of Ebola vaccines (odds ratio 0·22, 95% CI 0·21–0·22, and 1·40, 1·39–1·42) and seeking formal health care (0·06, 0·05–0·06, and 1·16, 1·15–1·17). Interpretation The findings underscore the practical implications of mistrust and misinformation for outbreak control. These factors are associated with low compliance with messages of social and behavioural change and refusal to seek formal medical care or accept vaccines, which in turn increases the risk of spread of EVD.

Gender and study-level differences were investigated. Over 60% of respondents had shared misinformation. The top reasons were related to the information's perceived characteristics, as well as self-expression and socializing. Accuracy and authoritativeness did not rank highly. Women had a higher prevalence of sharing and intention to share misinformation. Undergraduate and graduate students differed in their reasons for sharing misinformation. The former share (and intend to share) more misinformation than the latter, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Machine-learning approaches have predictive potential for individual-patient prognostic purposes and might thus aid translational efforts in psychiatric research. OBJECTIVE: To predict treatment response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on an individual-patient level based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 49 patients free of medication for at least 4 weeks and with a primary diagnosis of PD/AG in a longitudinal study performed at 8 clinical research institutes and outpatient centers across Germany. The functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted between July 2007 and March 2010. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve CBT sessions conducted 2 times a week focusing on behavioral exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Treatment response was defined as exceeding a 50% reduction in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Blood oxygenation level-dependent signal was measured during a differential fear-conditioning task. Regional and whole-brain gaussian process classifiers using a nested leave-one-out cross-validation were used to predict the treatment response from data acquired before CBT. RESULTS: Although no single brain region was predictive of treatment response, integrating regional classifiers based on data from the acquisition and the extinction phases of the fear-conditioning task for the whole brain yielded good predictive performance (accuracy, 82%; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 72%; P <\u2009.001). Data from the acquisition phase enabled 73% correct individual-patient classifications (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 67%; P <\u2009.001), whereas data from the extinction phase led to an accuracy of 74% (sensitivity, 64%; specificity, 83%; P <\u2009.001). Conservative reanalyses under consideration of potential confounders yielded nominally lower but comparable accuracy rates (acquisition phase, 70%; extinction phase, 71%; combined, 79%).

Many studies have found little stability in repeated measures of the respondent's own expressed position on issues and ideology. Two basic interpretations have been offered. Converse (1970) initially argued that many respondents without attitudes responded randomly and that there were two groups of respondents, one with stable attitudes and the other simply expressing a random response reflecting their nonattitudes. Achen (1975) and others argued instead that the fault was not that of the respondents, but that vague questions encouraged a variability in response, a measurement error that would be differentiated from the respondent's true underlying stable attitude.

Within Beck's cognitive model of depression, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which activated self-schemas result in the production of negative thoughts.

The authors posit the theory that inhibitory dysfunction may influence the degree to which activated self-schemas result in the production of depressive cognition. Method. Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 43) versus healthy (n = 36) and non-depressed anxious (n = 32) controls were assessed on the Prose Distraction Task (PDT), a measure of cognitive inhibition, and the Stop-Signal Task (SST), a measure of motor response inhibition. These two tasks were modified in order to present emotionally valenced semantic stimuli (i.e. negative, neutral, positive). Results. Participants with MDD demonstrated performance impairments on the PDT, which were most pronounced for negatively valenced adjectives, relative to both control groups. Moreover, these impairments correlated with self-report measures of negative thinking and rumination.

Thus, fake news detection is attracting increasing attention. However, fake news detection is a non-trivial task, which requires multi-source information such as news content, social context, and dynamic information. First, fake news is written to fool people, which makes it difficult to detect fake news simply based on news contents. In addition to news contents, we need to explore social contexts such as user engagements and social behaviors. For example, a credible user\'s comment that "this is a fake news" is a strong signal for detecting fake news. Second, dynamic information such as how fake news and true news propagate and how users\' opinions toward news pieces are very important for extracting useful patterns for (early) fake news detection and intervention.

However, infrastructure protection is also a continual process in which the defender and attacker interact to produce dynamic states affecting their best actions, as witnessed in the continual attack and defense of transmission networks in Colombia and Yemen. In this paper, we use zero-sum Markov games to model these interactions subject to underlying uncertainties of real-world events and actions. We solve equilibrium mixed strategies of the players that maximize their respective minimum payoffs with a time-decayed metric. We also show how the defender can use deception as a defense mechanism. Using results for a 5-bus system, a WECC 9-bus system, and an IEEE standard 14-bus system, we illustrate that our game model can provide useful insights.

Upon verification, users can also turn into non-believers and spread the same attitude with a mechanism analogous to that of the hoax-spreaders. Both believers and non-believers, as time passes, can return to a susceptible state.

Simulations on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and real networks for a wide range of parameters values reveal a threshold for the fact-checking probability that guarantees the complete removal of the hoax from the network.

To overcome this disadvantage, a methodology is proposed for reformulating a broad class of security patches into honey-patches - patches that offer equivalent security but that frustrate attackers' ability to determine whether their attacks have succeeded or failed. When an exploit attempt is detected, the honey-patch transparently and efficiently redirects the attacker to an unpatched decoy, where the attack is allowed to succeed.

Such depressive perception may result not only from biased cognitive appraisal but also from automatic processing biases that influence the access of sensory information to awareness. Method Twenty patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 20 healthy control participants underwent behavioural testing with a variant of binocular rivalry, continuous flash suppression (CFS), to investigate the potency of emotional visual stimuli to gain access to awareness. While a neutral, fearful, happy or sad emotional face was presented to one eye, high-contrast dynamic patterns were presented to the other eye, resulting in initial suppression of the face from awareness. Participants indicated the location of the face with a key press as soon as it became visible. The modulation of suppression time by emotional expression was taken as an index of unconscious emotion processing. Results We found a significant difference in the emotional modulation of suppression time between MDD patients and controls. This difference was due to relatively shorter suppression of sad faces and, to a lesser degree, to longer suppression of happy faces in MDD. Suppression time modulation by sad expression correlated with change in self-reported severity of depression after 4 weeks.

It finds an “echo chamber effect”: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation.

In this paper we build and test theory concerning a significant threat to the accuracy of information requirements, termed the misinformation effect. Misinformation is distorted, false, or other erroneous or misleading information that does not reflect the true state of the world or state of mind of the person communicating the information. The misinformation effect refers to the tendency of people to recall misleading or false information introduced to them following an event instead of original material learned or observed at the time the event occurred. During user-analyst communication in the IRD process, analysts may introduce misinformation in their discussions with users. We use the misinformation effect literature to hypothesize that in such circumstances users are likely to recall misinformation introduced by analysts rather than their true beliefs and knowledge of facts. Additionally, we use literature in social psychology to hypothesize that the misinformation effect will be stronger when misinformation is introduced using a social technique rather than a nonsocial technique. We conducted an experiment to test the misinformation effect in the requirements elicitation process. Results indicated that (1) introduction of misinformation reduces the accuracy of requirements provided by users, and (2) social techniques (interviews) are more vulnerable to the misinformation effect than nonsocial techniques (surveys). Our research contributes to the information systems literature by identifying an important reason that requirements provided by users may be inaccurate, and to IRD practice by identifying important dilemmas caused by the misinformation effect as well as potential solutions.

METHOD: We assessed 704 subjects (age 6-12 years) from a non-referred sample using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) and classified them into five groups: typical developing controls (TDC; n = 378), Fear disorders (n = 90), Distress disorders (n = 57), ADHD (n = 100), ODD/CD (n = 40) and ADHD+ODD/CD (n = 39). We evaluated neurocognitive performance with a Two-Choice Reaction Time Task (2C-RT), a Conflict Control Task (CCT) and a Go/No-Go (GNG) task. We used a diffusion model (DM) to decompose BIP into processing efficiency, speed-accuracy trade-off and encoding/motor function along with variability parameters. RESULTS: Poorer processing efficiency was found to be specific to ADHD. Faster encoding/motor function differentiated ADHD from TDC and from fear/distress whereas a more cautious (not impulsive) response style differentiated ADHD from both TDC and ODD/CD. The co-morbidity between ADHD and ODD/CD reflected only additive effects. All ADHD-related IB-EF classical effects were fully moderated by deficits in BIP.

However, little is known about attention performance in unaffected siblings. Hence, we examined sustained attention and reaction time in youths with ADHD, unaffected siblings and controls to test whether impaired performance in attention tasks can be a potential endophenotype of ADHD. Method We recruited 438 probands with clinical diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria, 180 unaffected siblings, and 173 healthy controls without lifetime ADHD. They were assessed using psychiatric interviews, Conners’ Continuous Performance Test, and the tasks involving attention performance of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB): Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Reaction Time (RTI) and Match to Sample Visual Search (MTS). Multi-level models were used for data analysis. Results Compared with the controls, probands with ADHD and unaffected siblings had significantly higher total misses, lower probability of hits in the RVP task and probands with ADHD performed worse in the RTI and MTS tasks after controlling for sex, age, co-morbidity, parental educational levels and IQ. The duration of methylphenidate use and IQ but not psychiatric co-morbidity or current use of methylphenidate were associated with deficits in sustained attention in probands with ADHD.

Cognitive studies have indicated sensitivity in PTSD for traumatic information, more so than general emotional information. These findings were supported by neuroimaging studies that identify increased brain activity during traumatic cognition, especially in affective networks (including the amygdala, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex). In theory, it is proposed that traumatic cognition may interfere with neutral cognition and there is evidence of abnormal neutral stimulus processing in PTSD. Firstly, PTSD patients perform poorly on a variety of neuropsychology tasks that involve attention and memory for neutral information. The evidence from event-related potentials and functional neuroimaging also indicates abnormal results in PTSD during neutral stimulus processing. The research evidence generally provides support for theories of trauma sensitivity and abnormal neutral stimulus processing in PTSD. However, there is only tentative evidence that trauma cognition concurrently interferes with neutral cognition. There is even some evidence that traumatic or novelty arousal processes can increase the capacity for attentive processing, thereby enhancing cognition for neutral stimulus information.

However, no neurobiological markers have been identified that prospectively predict MDD course trajectories. This study evaluated the prognostic value of different neuroimaging modalities, clinical characteristics, and their combination to classify MDD course trajectories. METHODS: One hundred eighteen MDD patients underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (emotional facial expressions and executive functioning) and were clinically followed-up at 2 years. Three MDD trajectories (chronic n = 23, gradual improving n = 36, and fast remission n = 59) were identified based on Life Chart Interview measuring the presence of symptoms each month. Gaussian process classifiers were employed to evaluate prognostic value of neuroimaging data and clinical characteristics (including baseline severity, duration, and comorbidity). RESULTS: Chronic patients could be discriminated from patients with more favorable trajectories from neural responses to various emotional faces (up to 73% accuracy) but not from structural MRI and functional MRI related to executive functioning. Chronic patients could also be discriminated from remitted patients based on clinical characteristics (accuracy 69%) but not when age differences between the groups were taken into account.

Cultural norms and beliefs were compatible with fertility control and womens work. Women were expected to control reproduction through rhythm or a form of abstinence. Barriers to fertility control included a lack of communication about sexual and contraceptive matters with friends family or spouses. This pattern of silence was handed down from their mothers. Almost 66% of the 30 women had never received information on menstruation or reproduction when growing up. The message was that sexuality was dangerous and shameful. Almost 33% engaged in a living arrangement with a sexual partner at the age of 14-16 years and the remaining had done so by 17-20 years. Marriage occurred accidentally or by force (25%). Voluntary cohabitation occurred in about 50% of cases. After sexual contact occurred parents strongly urged marriage. Women eventually learned about contraception through womens clubs clinics church groups husbands or friends. When fertility control failed women resorted to extreme abstinence abortion infanticide or modern methods. Modern methods were viewed as dangerous and with harmful side effects; modern medicine was viewed similarly. Contraceptive use could be associated with promiscuity. Women feared being touched by health personnel. Although abortion was illegal women conveyed a desire to end an unwanted pregnancy or acted with systematic neglect to end an unwanted birth.

However, it also enables the wide propagation of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information. Detecting fake news is an important task, which not only ensures users receive authentic information but also helps maintain a trustworthy news ecosystem. The majority of existing detection algorithms focus on finding clues from news contents, which are generally not effective because fake news is often intentionally written to mislead users by mimicking true news. Therefore, we need to explore auxiliary information to improve detection. The social context during news dissemination process on social media forms the inherent tri-relationship, the relationship among publishers, news pieces, and users, which has the potential to improve fake news detection. For example, partisan-biased publishers are more likely to publish fake news, and low-credible users are more likely to share fake news. In this paper, we study the novel problem of exploiting social context for fake news detection. We propose a tri-relationship embedding framework TriFN, which models publisher-news relations and user-news interactions simultaneously for fake news classification. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods for fake news detection.', 27884.0351820963, 35, 0.0989827856025039, 4.70735061672047e-05), (1978016254, 'Recognition performance level and the magnitude of the misinformation effect in eyewitness memory.', 'David G.

In this paper, after summarizing the details of that event, we outline the recipe of how social networks are used to spread misinformation. One of the most important steps in such a recipe is the "infiltration" of a community of users who are already engaged in conversations about a topic, to use them as organic spreaders of misinformation in their extended subnetworks.

The effects of variables relating to both the presentation of the misinformation and to the assessment of suggestibility were examined both immediately and following delays of 1 week (Experiment 1) or both 1 week and 1 month (Experiment 2). Older children were less suggestible than younger. Children were less suggestible when suggestibility was assessed in recall questions rather than misleading questions, less suggestible when information was central rather than peripheral and when the misinformation contradicted rather than supplemented the original event, and less suggestible over time in the absence of further suggestions. Providing cues had a small effect in enhancing resistance to the misinformation, but only when children were tested immediately. Embedding suggestions in a narrative context and repeating suggestions within a session led to greater suggestibility for both age groups, and repeating suggestions following a 1-month delay had a particularly marked effect for the younger children. These findings are consistent with the view that suggestibility effects depend on the strength of the memory trace for the original information as well as that for the suggestion.

We compare their behavior to a random set of Twitter users, finding interesting differences in terms of the content they disseminate, the evolution of their account, as well as their general behavior and use of Twitter. Then, using Hawkes Processes, we quantify the influence that trolls had on the dissemination of news on social platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan.

The dimension of the asymptotically AdS Hilbert space turns out to become a random variable $Z$, whose value can be less than the naive number $k$ of independent states in the theory. For $k>Z$, consistency arises from an exact degeneracy in the inner product defined by the gravitational path integral, so that many a priori independent states differ only by a null state.

Our pilot study is an initial attempt to measure a number of the top shared health misinformation stories in the Polish language social media. Methods Using the BuzzSumo Application, a range of the top shared health web links in the Polish language social media was assessed during the period between 2012 and 2017. We used the following keywords which were related to the most common diseases and causes of death: cancer, neoplasm, heart attack, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, vaccinations, HIV, and AIDS. Each link was checked for the presence of fake news. Results 40% of the most frequently shared links contained text we classified as fake news. These were shared more than 450,000 times.

Most previous structural imaging studies of ADHD reported abnormality of grey matter volume in prefrontal region. However, volume measure is affected by the size of the interrogated brain, which may cause the inconsistence of the volume based findings. The purpose of the current paper is to use a scale-free measure, fractal information dimension (FID), to assess the prefrontal cortical convolution complexity and asymmetry in ADHD patients. Methods: MRI scans from 12 boys with ADHD and 11 controls were carefully processed. Prefrontal cortex was outlined manually. FIDs of bilateral prefrontal cortical surface were examined in each case. Group differences of the bilateral prefrontal cortical convolution complexities and the asymmetry pattern were statistically tested. Results: We found a left-greater-thanright prefrontal cortical convolution complexity pattern in both groups. However, compared with healthy controls, the left prefrontal cortical convolution complexities of ADHD patients were significantly reduced, resulting in significant reduction of the normal left-greater-than-right cortical convolution complexity asymmetry pattern. Conclusion: This study confirms and extends the existing anatomical knowledge about the brains of people with ADHD.

This however comes at the cost of dubious trustworthiness and significant risk of exposure to 'fake news', intentionally written to mislead the readers. Automatically detecting fake news poses challenges that defy existing content-based analysis approaches. One of the main reasons is that often the interpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social context or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing. Recent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social media, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic fake news detection. Propagation-based approaches have multiple advantages compared to their content-based counterparts, among which is language independence and better resilience to adversarial attacks. In this paper we show a novel automatic fake news detection model based on geometric deep learning. The underlying core algorithms are a generalization of classical CNNs to graphs, allowing the fusion of heterogeneous data such as content, user profile and activity, social graph, and news propagation. Our model was trained and tested on news stories, verified by professional fact-checking organizations, that were spread on Twitter. Our experiments indicate that social network structure and propagation are important features allowing highly accurate (92.7% ROC AUC) fake news detection.

These results demonstrate that the eyewitness memory of children who lack either multirepresentational abilities, sufficient general memory abilities, or both (i.e., most 3- and 4-year-olds) is less accurate than the eyewitness memory of children with both multirepresentational abilities and sufficient memory abilities (i.e., most 6-year-olds and adults).

We used two complementary modalities – event-related potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – to test for abnormal activity associated with early visual signaling. Method We acquired fMRI and ERP data in separate sessions from 15 unmedicated individuals in each of three groups (weight-restored AN, BDD, and healthy controls) while they viewed images of faces and houses of different spatial frequencies. We used joint independent component analyses to compare activity in visual systems. Results AN and BDD groups demonstrated similar hypoactivity in early secondary visual processing regions and the dorsal visual stream when viewing low spatial frequency faces, linked to the N170 component, as well as in early secondary visual processing regions when viewing low spatial frequency houses, linked to the P100 component. Additionally, the BDD group exhibited hyperactivity in fusiform cortex when viewing high spatial frequency houses, linked to the N170 component. Greater activity in this component was associated with lower attractiveness ratings of faces.

Methods Patients with major depressive disorder completed two rtfMRI-nf sessions (18 received amygdalar rtfMRI-nf, 16 received control parietal rtfMRI-nf). One week before and following rtfMRI-nf training, participants performed tasks measuring responses to emotionally valenced stimuli including a backward-masking task, which measures the amygdalar hemodynamic response to emotional faces presented for traditionally subliminal duration and followed by a mask, and the Emotional Test Battery in which reaction times and performance accuracy are measured during tasks involving emotional faces and words. Results During the backward-masking task, amygdalar responses increased while viewing masked happy faces but decreased to masked sad faces in the experimental versus control group following rtfMRI-nf.

First, much published medical research is not reliable or is of uncertain reliability, offers no benefit to patients, or is not useful to decision makers. Second, most healthcare professionals are not aware of this problem. Third, they also lack the skills necessary to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of medical evidence. Finally, patients and families frequently lack relevant, accurate medical evidence and skilled guidance at the time of medical decision-making.

The techniques of using physical characteristics for identification can be traced to the ancient Egyptians who used the biometric of height (Roberts, 2003). Today the most widely recognized biometric is the fingerprint, which has been in use for over a century. At its inception, fingerprinting required the manual processing of matching between 20 and 7 minutiae points on the whorls, arches, and loops of a fingerprint (Short, 2002). By the mid-1970s, the process had been automated in the US by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) now used throughout the world (Roberts, 2003). Enabled by the accelerated changes in technological power, other biometrics came to be used, such as hand geometry, iris and retina scanning, voice, and handwriting verification (Harris & Yen, 2002). Today biometric devices are used in diverse organizational settings ranging from cafeterias for school children (Graziano, 2003) to white-collar employees at the Mitsubishi Motors North America plant (Maher, 2003) to doctors at the University of Arizona Medical Center (Worthen, 2002). The reasons for these implementations are also various. The school cafeteria utilizes the system to track student expenses so that parents only pay for the lunches actually eaten, rather than a lump sum for a full semester. The five hundred Mitsubishi Motors white-collar employees use biometrics to clock in when they arrive at their desks in order to monitor their productivity and time on the job. The doctors have their fingerprints scanned instead of using passwords for logging onto their computer systems, thereby increasing security and saving time in the process. The savings for using biometrics in organizational settings to eliminate passwords and their associated calls to the help desk have been estimated at $50 to $100 per call (Hulme, 2003). When comparing this to the one time cost of current fingerprint scanners of under $100 each (Louwers & VanDenburgh, 2003), the organization's return on investment seems self-evident. Given the advantages of using a biometric system for monitoring employees and increasing security of information as well as access to buildings, it is not surprising that the industry is expected to grow from $93.4 million in 2001 (Hulme, 2003) to $4 billion in 2007 (Roberts, 2003). However, even with the wide adaptability of the technology to various organizational functions, the acceptance of biometrics has been slow. Reasons cited for hesitancy to use biometric devices include lack of confidence in the reliability, difficulties integrating with other systems, and getting people to change their work patterns (Hulme, 2003). However, the most often cited obstacle is user apprehension (Calderon & Subbaiah, 2003; Fratto, 2003; Roberts, 2003) Thus, despite these advantages, it has been reported that public perceptions of biometrics can hinder their acceptance. In order to address these perceptions, it is first necessary to identify them. This paper presents the findings from a survey of 300 respondents regarding their familiarity with and acceptance of biometric devices. It begins with a brief discussion of commonly used biometric devices, presents the survey methodology and results, and concludes with suggestions for alleviating misconceptions through education. Common Types of Biometric Devices The most common biometric devices used today include: fingerprint scans, iris scans, retina scans, voice recognition, and handwriting recognition. Each will be discussed briefly below. In every case, the initial process for using biometric devices is to enroll the participants in the system by taking several samples of the biometric to be used in order to create a biometric template. The template consists of binary numbers, making it impossible to re-create the biometric sample from the template. …", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2925285378, 'An overview of online fake news: Characterization, detection, and discussion', 'Xichen Zhang (University of New Brunswick), Ali A.

Users of online social media share information, connect with other people and stay informed about trending events. However, much recent information appearing on social media is dubious and, in some cases, intended to mislead. Such content is often called fake news. Large amounts of online fake news has the potential to cause serious problems in society. Many point to the 2016\u202fU.S. presidential election campaign as having been influenced by fake news. Subsequent to this election, the term has entered the mainstream vernacular. Moreover it has drawn the attention of industry and academia, seeking to understand its origins, distribution and effects. Of critical interest is the ability to detect when online content is untrue and intended to mislead. This is technically challenging for several reasons. Using social media tools, content is easily generated and quickly spread, leading to a large volume of content to analyse. Online information is very diverse, covering a large number of subjects, which contributes complexity to this task. The truth and intent of any statement often cannot be assessed by computers alone, so efforts must depend on collaboration between humans and technology. For instance, some content that is deemed by experts of being false and intended to mislead are available. While these sources are in limited supply, they can form a basis for such a shared effort. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the finding to date relating to fake news. We characterize the negative impact of online fake news, and the state-of-the-art in detection methods.

In the July 2005 issue of the Journal of the National Medical Association, Brandon, Isaac and LaVeist (the authors), who were at the Center for Health Disparities Solutions, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, reported the results of black-white differences in awareness of and knowledge about the TSUS and the effect of that awareness and knowledge on medical mistrust. The study surveyed blacks, whites and others in the Baltimore, MD community about their knowledge of and attitudes about the TSUS. The respondents who were aware of the TSUS were asked survey items to assess specific factual information about the TSUS. The respondents who were not aware of the TSUS were read a brief description of the TSUS taken from the CDC website. Both groups were asked if a similar study was possible today. The authors performed a regression analysis of mistrust of medical care based on race, knowledge of the TSUS and demographic variables. The editorial identified and explained challenges in the article, i.e., challenges in calculations, demographic analysis by race, knowledge of TSUS, cultural sensitivity and methodology. The authors miscalculated the "similar proportions" of blacks and whites who were aware of the TSUS; the recalculated proportions, favoring whites, were different than reported by others. There was no demographic analysis by race in their article--also different than other published reports. Most respondents--blacks and whites--who were aware of the TSUS at baseline answered incorrectly the author-selected questions about the TSUS, particularly the fact-based question of whether the TSUS researchers gave syphilis to the men-not dissimilar to one other report. The source for TSUS information (the CDC website) that was used to educate respondents who were not aware of the TSUS at baseline had contradictions, errors and challenges in black history, medical and public health history, and women\'s studies. The content of what was actually read to respondents was unknown. Proportionally more whites who were not aware of the TSUS but who were read author-selected information about the TSUS believed that a similar study could happen today-a belief and possibly mistrust of medical care that appeared to be induced-compared to whites with prestudy awareness of the TSUS but not read information from the CDC website. Both black groups were not dissimilar from each other. The authors used a survey that measured a race difference in response to a medical event (TSUS) specific to only one racial group (blacks) when there were inclusive examples specific to other groups available. The authors used "Tuskegee" as a single-word sound bite for the TSUS--a misuse that was inappropriate in scientific and research discourse and that may fuel mistrust of medical care. Whether knowledge of the TSUS was a predictor of mistrust of the healthcare system was inconclusive based on the results in the authors\' article. The core findings of the article made believing their case difficult.

Thirty-two male delinquents and matched healthy controls were presented with a series of animated morph-clips that gradually display the onset and development of angry, fearful, and happy facial expressions. ASPD subjects required significantly higher levels of emotional intensity to correctly identify the onset of an angry facial expression as compared to control participants. In contrast, recognition of fearful and happy expressions was unimpaired. These findings suggest a specific deficit in the identification of hostile facial expressions in ASPD populations. Successful social interaction is a highly dynamic process of interpersonal adjustment that relies on the competence to understand those with whom we interact. The ability to correctly assess nonverbal emotional information extracted from facial expressions modulates social interaction and is crucial to the development of interpersonal skills and adaptive behavior. Particularly under circumstances of high uncertainty, a quick identification of subtle changes in emotional facial expressions is necessary in order to discriminate between friend and foe, thus allowing for an adequate and quick response to potential oncoming threat. There is a wealth of evidence demonstrating that clinical populations, especially anxious individuals, are more sensitive to salient facial expressions of direct threat (anger) and indirect threat (fear) (Cisler, Bacon, & Williams, 2009; Staugaard, 2010).

Results from a pre-registered experiment indicate that false headlines are perceived as less accurate when people receive a general warning about misleading information on social media or when specific headlines are accompanied by a “Disputed” or “Rated false” tag. Though the magnitudes of these effects are relatively modest, they generally do not vary by whether headlines were congenial to respondents’ political views. In addition, we find that adding a “Rated false” tag to an article headline lowers its perceived accuracy more than adding a “Disputed” tag (Facebook’s original approach) relative to a control condition. Finally, though exposure to the “Disputed” or “Rated false” tags did not affect the perceived accuracy of unlabeled false or true headlines, exposure to a general warning decreased belief in the accuracy of true headlines, suggesting the need for further research into how to most effectively counter false news without distorting belief in true information.', 11077.2569806148, 9, 0.0856236786469345, 2.6454808808871e-05), (2102444793, 'The effects of balance training intervention on postural control of children with autism spectrum disorder: Role of sensory information', 'Hakim Cheldavi (Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz), Saeid Shakerian (Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz), Seyedeh Nahid Shetab Boshehri (Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz), Mehdi Zarghami (Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz)', 2014, 28, 'Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of balance training intervention in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and to explore the relative role of the sensory systems in such kids.

Such individuals report particular difficulty controlling worry once it is initiated. Information processing models of GAD propose that the way in which anxious individuals process threatening information has a causal role in initiating and maintaining worry. There is substantial evidence that individuals with GAD and high levels of worry and anxiety demonstrate a threatening attentional bias, whereby they preferentially attend to threatening information in their environment. There is also substantial evidence that individuals with GAD demonstrate a threatening interpretive bias, in which they favour the threatening meanings of emotionally ambiguous events or information. Recent research has indicated that it may be possible to train high anxious individuals to adopt more benign attentional and interpretive biases, and furthermore, that this may cause their level of anxiety and worry to decrease. There is far less evidence that anxious individuals show enhanced memory for threatening information. However, high levels of anxiety and worry have been associated with reduced working memory capacity (a limited capacity store needed to engage in different tasks and switch between tasks), due to worry taking up limited resources. This may make it more difficult for individuals with GAD to redirect their thoughts away from worry and onto more benign topics, therefore causing their worry to persist.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (1967060364, 'Pilgrims Sailing the Titanic: Plausibility Effects on Memory for Misinformation', 'Scott R.

Studies of the continued influence effect have shown, however, that corrections are not entirely effective in reversing the effects of initial misinformation. Instead, participants continue to rely on the discredited misinformation when asked to draw inferences and make judgments about the news story. Most prior studies have employed misinformation that explicitly states the likely cause of an outcome. However, news stories do not always provide misinformation explicitly, but instead merely imply that something or someone might be the cause of an adverse outcome. Two experiments employing both direct and indirect measures of misinformation reliance were conducted to assess whether implied misinformation is more resistant to correction than explicitly stated misinformation. The results supported this prediction. Experiment 1 showed that corrections reduced misinformation reliance in both the explicit and implied conditions, but the correction was much less effective following implied misinformation. Experiment 2 showed that implied misinformation was more resistant to correction than explicit misinformation, even when the correction was paired with an alternative explanation. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that greater resistance to correction in the implied misinformation condition did not reflect greater disbelief in the correction.

Both cardiac (ECR) and cortical (LPP) evoked orienting responses were measured and both were enhanced for the pictures with humans, in particular for the unpleasant ones. Results No significant group differences were found, nor were there any treatment effects. Moderator analysis, however, demonstrated that OXT did enhance orienting to affective pictures with humansin male adults with ASD who are easily distressed when seeing others in stressful situations and in healthy males who are highly sensitive to anticipated punishment and criticism or have a low drive for goal achievement.

We sought to analyze the magnitude of misinformation that is being spread on Twitter\xa0(Twitter, Inc., San Francisco, CA) regarding the coronavirus epidemic.\xa0 Materials and methods We conducted a search on Twitter using 14 different trending hashtags and keywords related to the COVID-19 epidemic. We then summarized and assessed individual tweets for misinformation in comparison to verified and peer-reviewed resources. Descriptive statistics were used to compare\xa0terms and hashtags, and to identify individual tweets and account characteristics. Results The study included 673 tweets. Most tweets were posted by informal individuals/groups (66%), and 129 (19.2%) belonged to verified Twitter accounts. The majority of included tweets contained serious content (91.2%); 548 tweets (81.4%) included genuine information pertaining to the COVID-19 epidemic. Around 70% of the tweets tackled medical/public health information, while the others were pertaining to sociopolitical and financial factors. In total, 153 tweets (24.8%) included misinformation, and 107 (17.4%) included unverifiable information regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. The rate of misinformation was higher among informal individual/group accounts (33.8%, p: <0.001). Tweets from unverified Twitter accounts contained more misinformation (31.0% vs 12.6% for verified accounts, p: <0.001). Tweets from healthcare/public health accounts had the lowest rate of unverifiable information (12.3%, p: 0.04). The number of likes and retweets per tweet was not associated with a difference in either false or unverifiable content. The keyword "COVID-19" had the lowest rate of misinformation and unverifiable information, while the keywords "#2019_ncov" and "Corona" were associated with the highest amount of misinformation and unverifiable content respectively. Conclusions Medical misinformation and unverifiable content pertaining to the global COVID-19 epidemic are being propagated at an alarming rate on social media.

Wallace, University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USADOI: 10.1177/1077699012472036One of my few firmly held opinions is that nothing spoils a perfectly good bratwurst like learning how it is produced. However, despite seeing episodes of Dirty Jobs and How It\'s Made detailing exactly that manufacturing process in all its glory, I have managed to cling to my enjoyment of sausage (although I admit to an occasional unpleasant flashback). I have similar feelings about humor. Among the useful things I learned in a rhetorical criticism class in graduate school was that great humor can be absolutely ruined by discussion and analysis. As such, it was with more than mild trepidation that I approached The Stewart/Colbert Effect: Essays on the Real Impacts of Fake News.This volume is a thoughtful collection of contributed essays, edited by Amarnath Amarasingam, a doctoral candidate at Wilfred Laurier University in Ontario, Canada, that attempts to "provide a new theoretical perspective" and to study the "overall social significance of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert." The collection is divided into two parts: "New Research" and "Theoretical Considerations." Part 1, the research portion of the book, details five academic studies focused on the following questions: Do The Daily Show and Colbert Report bring attention to science and technology issues in the same way and with the same impact as they bring to politics? To what extent does The Daily Show provide its audience with "simple rules of thumb" (heuristics) allowing it to form attitudes about issues without going to all the trouble to carefully consider the related facts? Has the impact of The Daily Show on young adults and their political engagement been overdramatized in popular culture? Are The Daily Show and Colbert Report actually the authentic (real) news and much of the mainstream political coverage inauthentic (fake)? Finally, does The Daily Show benefit democracy by holding politicians and journalists accountable, or does it undermine democracy by promoting disengagement and alienation from the political process? These are all great questions!There are noteworthy strengths and weaknesses in the studies in Part 1. A significant strength of all the essays is the quality of the literature reviews and theoretical underpinnings of the studies being reported. Many provide first-rate models for making an argument supporting a research question or hypothesis. In addition, perhaps especially because I am not familiar with research in this area, the reviews provided marvelous contextual foundations for understanding the nature and importance of each study. Likewise, the methods used in the studies were very clearly described and should be clear to even novice students of research. The weaknesses sometimes can be found in the choice and/or execution of the research methods, and in some cases conclusions were speculative and tangentially connected to the reported results.Nevertheless, both the strengths and the weaknesses make this book a valuable tool for classes in research methods or media analysis. It\'s challenging to teach the process of crafting a well-documented and well-argued literature review that provides a strong rationale for a study, but these readings generally provide good models for illustration of those qualities. As for the weaknesses, I do not mean to imply that this work is subpar: it is not. …', 0.0, 2, 0.0, 2.3226213633943e-05), (2052992637, 'Patterns of abnormal processing of emotional information in panic disorder and major depression.', 'Cameron S.

The present study investigated memory for a negative event encoded under stress and subsequent misinformation endorsement. Healthy young adults participated in a between- groups design with three experimental sessions conducted 48 h apart. Session one consisted of a psycho- social stress induction (or control task) followed by incidental encoding of a negative slideshow. During session two, participants were asked questions about the slideshow, during which a random subgroup was exposed to misinformation. Memory for the slideshow was tested during the third session. Assess- ment of memory accuracy across stress and no-stress groups revealed that stress induced just prior to encoding led to significantly better memory for the slideshow overall. The classic misinformation effect was also observed - participants exposed to misinformation were significantly more likely to endorse false information during memory testing. In the stress group, however, memory accuracy and misinfor- mation effects were moderated by arousal experienced during encoding of the negative event. Misin- formed-stress group participants who reported that the negative slideshow elicited high arousal during encoding were less likely to endorse misinformation for the most aversive phase of the story.

In reality, every paper contains misinformation; at issue is whether the balance of correct versus incorrect information is acceptable. This paper postulates that analysis of retracted research papers can provide insight into medical misinformation, although retracted papers are not a random sample of incorrect papers. Error is the most common reason for retraction and error may be the principal cause of misinformation as well. Still, one-quarter of retracted papers are fraudulent, and misinformation may also arise through fraud. This paper hypothesises that error and fraud are the main sources of misinformation and that error is more common than fraud. Retraction removes misinformation from the literature; bias is non-retracted misinformation. Bias arises when scientific impropriety results in false research findings. Impropriety can involve experimental design, data collection, data analysis, or data presentation. Yet impropriety also arises through earnest error or statistical naivete; not all bias is fraud. Several measures are proposed to minimise misinformation in the medical literature, including: greater detail in the clinical trial registry, with rigorous definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria and primary endpoints; clear statistical criteria for every aspect of clinical trials, especially sample size; responsibility for data integrity that accrues to all named authors; increased transparency as to how the costs of research were paid; and greater clarity as to the reasons for retraction.

When all individuals engage in this type of information exchange, the society will be able to effectively aggregate the initial information held by all individuals.

The paper characterizes how the presence of forceful agents interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even forceful agents obtain some information (however infrequent) from some others (and additional weak regularity conditions), we first show that beliefs in this class of societies converge to a consensus among all individuals.

Our main results quantify the extent of misinformation in the society by either providing bounds or exact results (in some special cases) on how far the consensus value can be from the benchmark without forceful agents (where there is efficient information aggregation).

In contrast, we focus on content-based detection of fake news articles, while assuming that we have a small amount of labels, made available by manual fact-checkers or automated sources. We argue this is a more realistic setting in the presence of massive amounts of content, most of which cannot be easily fact-checked.

Fake news articles, just like genuine news articles, leverage multimedia content to manipulate user opinions but spread misinformation. A shortcoming of the current approaches for the detection of fake news is their inability to learn a shared representation of multimodal (textual + visual) information. We propose an end-to-end network, Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), which uses a bimodal variational autoencoder coupled with a binary classifier for the task of fake news detection. The model consists of three main components, an encoder, a decoder and a fake news detector module. The variational autoencoder is capable of learning probabilistic latent variable models by optimizing a bound on the marginal likelihood of the observed data. The fake news detector then utilizes the multimodal representations obtained from the bimodal variational autoencoder to classify posts as fake or not.

In the young brain after temporal lobectomy, there exists a functional dissociation between judging the familiarity of an event and identifying its attributes, a dissociation that depends, not only on laterality of surgery, but also on the structural and functional intactness of the residual brain.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (1967419670, 'Habitual acceptance of misinformation: Examination of individual differences and source attributions', 'David R.

Methods: Twenty patients with BD and 20 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and handedness participated in this study. Subjects were seated in front of a monitor and listened to a story via earphones. Two types of windmill patterns (standard and deviant) and white circle (target) stimuli were randomly presented on the monitor.

The studies that we have done show how readily memory can become skewed when people are fed misinformation. They used a deceptively simple procedure. Subjects first see a complex event, such as a simulated automobile accident. Next, half the subjects receive misleading information about the accident while the others get no misinformation. Finally, all subjects try to remember the original accident. In one actual study using this paradigm, subjects saw an accident and later some of them received misinformation about the traffic sign used to control traffic. The misled subjects got the false suggestion that the stop sign that they had actually seen was a yield sign. When asked later what kind of traffic sign they remembered seeing at the intersection, those who had been given the false suggestion tended to adopt it as their memory, and now claimed that they had seen a yield sign (see Fig. 1). Those who had not received the phony information had much more accurate memories (see Loftus 1979). Taken together, the hundreds, if not thousands, of similar studies show that misinformation can change an individual’s recollection in predictable, and sometimes very powerful, ways. In this issue of Learning & Memory, Okado and Stark (2005) shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the misinformation effect. Misinformation can contaminate our memories when we talk to other people, when we are interrogated in a suggestive fashion, or when we see biased media coverage about some event that we may have experienced ourselves. After more than two decades exploring the power of misinformation, we have learned a great deal about the conditions that make people especially susceptible to its damaging influence. We have learned, for example, that memories are more easily modified when the passage of time allows the original memory to fade. Those faded, weakened memories become particularly vulnerable to contamination. When contemporary investigators began using neuroimaging and other physiological measures to explore true versus false memories, I had hoped that one day these would be applied to the misinformation paradigm. But in misinformation studies, there was often only one critical item (the subject was falsely led to remember a stop sign instead of a yield sign in the accident scene) and thus a maximum of one false memory per subject. Occasionally investigators might try to insert a few false items, but never very many to prevent subjects from catching on to the trick and rejecting the post-event misinformation wholesale. To do neuroimaging studies of true and false memories, investigators needed to have a decent number of false memories per subject to be able to compare them to true ones. An excellent paradigm for ensuring that a respectable number of false memories were produced was the DRM (after Deese-RoedigerMcDermott, based on work by Deese 1959 and Roediger III and McDermott 1995). In this procedure, subjects study a list of related words such as sour, candy, bitter, sugar, good, taste, tooth, nice, honey, soda, chocolate, cake, heart, tart, and pie. When later tested, subjects often think they heard or saw certain non-presented items (sweet, in this case). The procedure reliably led most subjects to produce a goodly number of false memories; that is, subjects would describe the falsely remembered word in detail, and gave every indication that they were remembering a real event. Thus, virtually all of the neuroimaging studies of true and false memories used the DRM paradigm, or some variant (e.g., Cabeza et al. 2001). Therefore, most of what we learned about the neurobiology of true and false memories was about the neurobiology of true and false memories of words, or at least about memories that were relatively pallid in nature. Enter the work of Okado and Stark (2005). First, and importantly, they developed materials that were far closer to the complex visual scenarios used in most of the misinformation research. Moreover, their procedure was one in which a decent number of false memories could be produced in a given subject, thereby allowing meaningful comparisons with the true memories. And in the process they have taught us something about the misinformation effect that can relate to the hundreds of behavioral studies that have been done on the topic. Okado and Stark (2005) used eight complex vignettes each of which were shown to participants through 50 color slides. One vignette, for example, depicted a man stealing a girl’s wallet and subsequently trying to hide. Thus, the materials were far more complex and “realistic” than had been used in the typical neuroimaging memory study. Subjects were scanned while they watched these original vignettes. Later, during the misinformation phase, subjects watched the vignettes again, under the belief that they were watching the same scenes. However, 12 critical slides were altered in some way. For example, if the original event showed the man hiding behind a door, the misinformation slide showed him hiding behind a tree. Two days later, subjects took a recognition test on their memory for the original scenarios. It included questions such as “Where was the man hiding after he stole the girl’s wallet and crossed the street? Behind a door? Behind a tree? Behind a car?” On a subsequent “source memory” test, subjects indicated the source of their memory for every answer they had given during the first recognition test. Thus, if they claimed on the recognition test that the man was hiding behind a tree, they would indicate that they knew this because they saw it in the original presentations, they saw it in the second set of presentations, they saw it in both, they noticed conflict, or they simply guessed. A misinformation error was observed whenever subjects said they saw the misinformation item (hiding behind a tree) during the original presentation (whether only then, or whether they said they saw this in both presentations).', 3662.9103645850605, 5, 0.15441176470588197, 2.4599961437249102e-05), (2797652359, 'The Web of False Information: Rumors, Fake News, Hoaxes, Clickbait, and Various Other Shenanigans', 'Savvas Zannettou (Cyprus University of Technology), Michael Sirivianos (Cyprus University of Technology), Jeremy Blackburn (University of Alabama at Birmingham), Nicolas Kourtellis (Telefónica)', 2019, 21, 'A new era of Information Warfare has arrived.

Automatic fake news identification is extremely hard, since pure model based fact-checking for news is still an open problem, and few existing models can be applied to solve the problem. With a thorough investigation of a fake news data, lots of useful explicit features are identified from both the text words and images used in the fake news. Besides the explicit features, there also exist some hidden patterns in the words and images used in fake news, which can be captured with a set of latent features extracted via the multiple convolutional layers in our model.

Despite efforts through conducting genome-wide association (GWA) studies, the success of identifying susceptibility loci for BPD has been limited, which is partially attributed to the complex nature of its pathogenesis.

Additionally, to incorporate other aspects of genomic data into pathway analysis may further enhance our understanding for the underlying mechanisms for BPD. Patterns of DNA methylation play important roles in regulating gene expression and function. A commonly observed phenomenon, allele-specific methylation (ASM) describes the associations between genetic variants and DNA methylation patterns. The present study aimed to identify biological pathways that are involve in the pathogenesis of BPD while incorporating brain specific ASM information in pathway analysis using two large-scale GWA datasets in Caucasian populations. A weighting scheme was adopted to take ASM information into consideration for each pathway. After multiple testing corrections, we identified 88 and 15 enriched pathways for their biological relevance for BPD in the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium dataset, respectively. Many of these pathways were significant only when applying the weighting scheme. Three ion channel related pathways were consistently identified in both datasets.

Drugs are selected based on continuous incubation of cells, then frequently administered to the patient as a bolus. Target identification and validation is often performed by gene suppression that inevitably mimics continuous target inhibition. Drug concentrations in vitro frequently far exceed in vivo concentrations. Studies of drug synergy are performed at sub-optimal concentrations.

The novel coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was a trending topic on the internet, using validated instruments and relating the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term "Wuhan Coronavirus" on the Google website (February 6, 2020). At the search time, the terms "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) did not exist. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark, the DISCERN instrument, and Google ranking. RESULTS: The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.8% (n=2) of the websites had the HONcode seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39.1% (n=43) of the websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool, and only 10.0% (11/110) of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70.0% (n=77) of the websites were evaluated as having a low score and none were rated as having a high score.

The incidence and impact of misconceptions and misperceptions, the article argues, are highly conditional on identity protective cognition. Identity protective cognition refers to the tendency of culturally diverse individuals to selectively credit and dismiss evidence in patterns that reflect the beliefs that predominate in their group. On issues that provoke identity-protective cognition, the members of the public most adept at avoiding misconceptions of science are nevertheless the most culturally polarized. Individuals are also more likely to accept misinformation and resist the correction of it when that misinformation is identity-affirming rather than identity-threatening. Effectively counteracting these dynamics, the paper argues, requires more than simply supplying citizens with correct information.

A possible definition comprises attempts to distort or mislead to achieve a certain perspective, i.e. subjective descriptions intended to mislead. If designers were able to exclude bias from informing systems, then this would maximize their effectiveness. This implicit conjecture appears to underpin much of the research in our field. However, in our efforts to support the evolution and design of informing systems, the way we think, communicate and conceptualize our efforts clearly influences our comprehension and consequently our agenda for design. Objectivity (an attempt to be neutral or transparent) is usually regarded as non-biased. However, claims for objectivity do not, by definition, include efforts to inquire into and reflect over subjective values. Attempts to externalize the mindset of the subject do not arise as part of the description. When claims to objectivity are made, this rarely includes any effort to make subjective bias transparent. Instead, objectivity claims may be regarded as a denial of bias. We suggest that bias can be introduced into overt attempts to admit subjectivity. For example, where people are asked to give subjective opinion according to an artificially enforced scale of truth-falsity (bi-valued logic), they may find themselves coerced into statements of opinion which do not truly reflect the views they might have wished to express. People do not naturally respond to their environment with opinions limited to restricted scales; rather, they tend to use multivalued logic.

Nevertheless, arachnids are becoming more popular as pets in Europe, America and Asia, raising the question for regulatory agencies in these regions as to whether they need to take measurements to protect their citizens. In order to decide upon the necessary regulatory steps, they first need to determine which arachnids are actually dangerous to humans.

As a guideline, we also provide a list of those arachnid genera that we consider as potentially dangerous, which includes 10 spider and 11 scorpion genera.

Methods: Thirty-two patients suffering from a major depressive episode (DSM-IV criteria), and 30 age- and education-matched normal control subjects participated in this study. After the presentation of a list of positive, negative, and neutral association items in the learning phase, subjects were asked to give a yes/no response in the recognition phase.

Results: The results revealed more negative false memories in the clinical depression group than in the normal control group; however, we did not find more negative false memories than positive ones in patients. When compared with the normal group, a more conservative response criterion for positive items was evident in patient groups. It was also found that when compared with the normal group, the subjects in the depression group perceived the positive items as less positive.

In addition, Clinical Guidance has also been produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (2008), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (2009) and the British National Formulary for Children (BNFC). An updated systematic review of the Contraindications sections of the SPCs of all medications currently licensed for treatment of ADHD in the UK was undertaken and independent statements regarding contraindications and relevant warnings and precautions were then compared with UK national guidance with the aim of assessing any disparity and potential areas of confusion for prescribers. As of November 2011, there were seven medications available in the UK for the treatment of ADHD. There are 15 contraindications for most formulations of methylphenidate, 14 for dexamfetamine and 5 for atomoxetine. Significant differences exist between the SPCs and national guidance part due to the ongoing reactive process of amending the former as new information becomes known. In addition, recommendations are made outside UK SPC licensed indications and a significant contraindication for methylphenidate (suicidal behaviours) is missing from both the NICE and SIGN guidelines. Particular disparity exists relating to monitoring for suicidal and psychiatric side effects. The BNFC has not yet been updated in line with the European Union (EU) Directive on methylphenidate; it does not include any contraindications for atomoxetine but describes contraindications for methylphenidate that are no longer in the SPC. Clinicians seeking prescribing advice from critical independent sources of data, such as SPCs and national guidelines, may be confused by the disparity that exists. There are major differences between guidelines and SPCs and neither should be referred to in isolation. The SPC represents the most relevant source of safety data to aid prescribing of medications for ADHD as they present the most current safety data in line with increased exposure. National guidelines may need more regular updates.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2012336753, 'Scholarly misconduct and misinformation on the World Wide Web', 'Philip James Calvert (Victoria University of Wellington)', 2001, 19, 'The World Wide Web is a potentially powerful channel for misinformation.

Objective To apply recent advancements in the investigation of 2-person human social interaction to investigate interaction difficulties among people with BPD. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-brain information flow in BPD was examined from May 25, 2012, to December 4, 2015, in pairs of participants studied in 2 linked functional magnetic resonance imaging scanners in a university setting. Participants performed a joint attention task. Each pair included a healthy control individual (HC) and either a patient currently fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for BPD (cBPD) (n\u2009=\u200923), a patient in remission for 2 years or more (rBPD) (n\u2009=\u200917), or a second HC (n\u2009=\u200920). Groups were matched for age and educational level. Main Outcomes and Measures A measure of cross-brain neural coupling was computed following previously published work to indicate synchronized flow between right temporoparietal junction networks (previously shown to host neural coupling abilities in health). This measure is derived from an independent component analysis contrasting the time courses of components between pairs of truly interacting participants compared with bootstrapped control pairs. Results In the sample including 23 women with cBPD (mean [SD] age, 26.8 [5.7] years), 17 women with rBPD (mean [SD] age, 28.5 [4.3] years), and 80 HCs (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [3.4] years]) investigated as dyads, neural coupling was found to be associated with disorder state ( η 2 \u2009=\u20090.17; P \u2009=\u2009.007): while HC-HC pairs showed synchronized neural responses, cBPD-HC pairs exhibited significantly lower neural coupling just above permutation-based data levels (η 2 \u2009=\u20090.16; P \u2009=\u2009.009). No difference was found between neural coupling in rBPD-HC and HC-HC pairs. The neural coupling in patients was significantly associated with childhood adversity ( T \u2009=\u20092.3; P \u2009=\u2009.03). Conclusions and Relevance This study provides a neural correlate for a core diagnostic and clinical feature of BPD.

Nine Greek primary school pupils with ADHD symptoms and four others with no such deficit worked on a computer, either individually or collaboratively, once a week for a six-week period. The pupils worked on a series of activities especially developed for the study, with educational software and ICT environments of different types and features. It was found that specific characteristics of the educational software used by the pupils with ADHD symptoms stimulated their attention more than others did. Pupils with ADHD symptoms appeared to prefer reading short texts, watching short videos, and listening to short narration items when they work on the computer. Furthermore, significant differences were observed on those pupils\' behavior and performance in learning tasks between individual and collaborative work. ********** The development of software applications that will meet the needs of pupils with various kinds of disabilities is a matter which appears to be compulsory today due to the necessity for universal access to information and communications services and for the development of software environments accessible to all (Shneiderman, 2000; Keates, Clarkson, & Robinson, 2002). Page (2002) referred to the positive effect that computers can have on "non-traditional" pupils, meaning all those who have been labeled as being learning disabled, low achieving, educationally disadvantaged, and so forth (p. 392). One of these groups of pupils at-risk for behavioral and academic problems is the group of children who exhibit attention deficit and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) syndrome is a diagnostic category used to describe individuals who display developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity, and/or overactivity (DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, & Reid, 1998). It is a lifelong neurobiologically-based developmental disability which is estimated to affect 2-9.5% of the school age population, based on research evidence world-wide, with boys outnumbering girls at about a 2:1 to 5:1 ratio (Fowler, 1994; Barkley, 1998). Research evidence in Greece estimated that 12.4% of elementary school pupils exhibit ADHD symptoms (Zournatzis, Kakouros, Karamba, Papaeliou, & Badikian, 2001). According to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (America Psychometric Association, 1994), the main symptoms of the syndrome are three: 1. Inattention. Individuals who have inattention problems display difficulties in focusing on a task, are easily distracted by extraneous stimuli, exhibit problems in organizing and completing their homework, often loose things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., books, pencils), and so forth. 2. Hyperactivity. Hyperactive individuals have difficulty in remaining seated while being in the classroom, are often fidgety and talk excessively, run about or climb in situations in which it is inappropriate, and so forth. 3. Impulsivity. Impulsive individuals act before thinking, have difficulty in waiting turn, often interrupt or intrude on others, blurt out answers before questions have been completed, and so forth. The DSM-IV categorizes these symptoms into three subtypes of the disorder: (a) predominantly inattentive, (b) predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and (c) combination of the two types. For a child to be diagnosed as having ADHD, these symptoms must be present in the child\'s behavior before age seven and must persist for at least six months in two or more settings (at school and at home) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2900144515, 'Detecting Fake News in Social Media Networks', 'Monther Aldwairi (Zayed University), Ali Alwahedi (Zayed University)', 2018, 18, 'Abstract Fake news and hoaxes have been there since before the advent of the Internet.

Inter-examiner reliability was fair to moderate for informative statements and poor to substantial for misleading statements. A mean of 1.8 informative statements were made per video, compared with misleading, 0.5. Many topics were rarely mentioned, with 19/30 themes appearing fewer than 5% of videos. Patients often informed that implants could improve aesthetics and function, but were misleading on aspects of pain control. Some statements may heighten expectations or imply permanency of treatment.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nBalanced presentation in YouTube testimonials may be limited by bias of clinician-uploaded content. Greater magnitude and breadth of information would improve educational value.

Our goal was to examine whether increasing retrieval demand would improve the relationship between confidence and memory performance, and thereby reduce misinformation susceptibility. We hypothesized that improving the relationship between confidence and memory performance would improve controlled processes at retrieval. That is, when confidence and memory performance were well calibrated, participants would be able to withhold incorrect responses if given the opportunity. To examine the relationship between memory retention, confidence, and controlled withholding, we compared older and younger adults’ performance on a forced memory test, where participants could not withhold responses, and on a free test, where participants were encouraged to withhold responses. Confidence judgments were collected after forced responding. Retrieval demand was manipulated indirectly through type of test (cued recall vs. recognition) and directly through retrieval instructions.

Sellnow , Robert S. Littlefield , Kathleen G. Vidoloff , Elizabeth M. Webb ', 2009, 18, 'The lingering threat and uncertainty generated by terrorism takes a psychological and financial toll. Potential victims live in nagging fear of future assaults. As Lerbinger (1997) explained, "In particular, it is the psychological element of malice that makes each terrorist act, no matter how small, deeply repugnant" (p. 145). Government agencies dedicate considerable financial resources to protecting citizens against terrorist assaults. This financial burden is complicated by the fact that terrorism is, by its nature, fraught with uncertainty. Government agencies can never be certain they have devoted sufficient resources for mitigating the most urgent terrorist threats. This uncertainty also diminishes the effectiveness of risk communication. Heath, McKinney, and Palenchar (2005) argued that terrorists exploit uncertainty in order to erode responders\' ability to "communicate knowledgeably on the facts and issues surrounding a specific risk" (p. 157). Such uncertainty is paramount in terrorist hoaxes. These false claims of attack increase anxiety and force government agencies to devote valuable resources in response to claims that never actually manifest in assault. Thus, terrorist hoaxes pose a notable challenge for government agencies who must respond to them. A significant component of this challenge involves risk communication. This study explores the complex communication required for responding to terrorist hoaxes. Specifically, the study examines the New Zealand government\'s risk communication in response to a bioterrorist hoax. In the study, we address the seemingly contradictory communication demands on government agents as they must explain that a threat is likely a hoax while noting simultaneously that they are responding as if the danger were genuine. Our analysis begins by reviewing the nature of terrorist hoaxes. We then characterize hoax responses as interacting arguments. Next, we apply this perspective to the New Zealand case. Finally, we offer a series of conclusions about the case and implications for communicating in a hoax environment. CONTEXTUAL FRAMEWORK Heath and O\'Hair (2008) vividly depict the inherent nature of uncertainty in terrorism with the statement, "uncertainty and instability are the playground of terrorism" (p. 25). By maximizing uncertainty, terrorists have the capacity to upset a system\'s stability. As such, uncertainty has the capacity to "demoralize and intimidate" innocent people (p. 25). Similarly, Heath et al. (2005) see uncertainty as a key variable in all communication surrounding terrorism. Ultimately, such uncertainty disrupts a targeted audience\'s ability to comprehend the actual likelihood of attack because the terrorists\' actions "focus attention on the malevolence of the act rather than the probability of the occurrence" (Heath & O\'Hair, p. 18). Clearly, hoaxers seek to heighten uncertainty by capitalizing on the fear that persists in a terrorist context. In other words, the fear of a looming attack, whether legitimate or not, can diminish the ability of a target audience to keep potential threats in proper perspective. Hoaxes appear with some regularity in a variety of settings. One such setting involves explosive devices placed on or near school campuses. Such devices have recently been detonated on school property in Colorado, Missouri, and Georgia (Dorn, 2001). These attacks have increased the uncertainty and, consequently, the impact of bomb threat hoaxes. Ronald D. Stephens, Executive Director of the National School Safety Center, suggests that such hoaxes create a notable financial burden, because "you\'ve got to respond as if it\'s the real thing every time" (Bowman, 2004, para. 10). This financial pressure is leading some school safety consultants to recommend preemptive strikes as a deterrent to hoaxers. Officials in states such as Vermont and New York have followed this advice by aggressively prosecuting such hoaxers at the felony level. …', 48.0, 2, 0.0357142857142857, 2.2451252728514398e-05), (1995795723, 'Integration of dynamic information for visuomotor control in young adults with developmental coordination disorder', 'Rita F. de Oliveira (University of London), Rita F. de Oliveira (German Sport University Cologne), John P.

We set up a steering task where the action goal was to steer smoothly on a virtual winding course under conditions that manipulated the availability and timing of visual information. Participants were 20 young adults who had been diagnosed with DCD in their childhood and 20 typically developing age-matched controls. On a simple tracking task, participants with DCD were slower and more variable than controls. The group differences dissipated, however, when the display highlighted the directional changes necessary within the next 500 ms. When the latter condition was modified to also include the full layout of the course, however, the performance of the DCD group once again decreased. This result could not be attributed to a simple distraction effect. The results suggest that distinct neural mechanisms are associated with the processing of fast visual information for online control and longer-term action preparation based on spatial layout. In skilled action, cerebellar and parietal areas process information effectively and their outputs are integrated into one smooth movement.

The present study focused on this latter finding, and examined attention as a potential factor moderating the relationship between initial testing and narrative detail production. We hypothesized that initial testing would influence endogenous attention allocation to details in the post-event narrative, thereby impacting narrative learning. We found that compared to participants who did not take an initial test, participants who took an initial test focused efforts on processing narrative details that were directly relevant to initial test questions, and this differential attention allocation was directly related to final test misinformation production. These experiments provide support for the view that testing enhances susceptibility to misinformation by potentiating learning of post-event information.

The use of these agents remains contentious, placing parents in a difficult position when deciding to initiate and/or continue their child's treatment.

Methods: Three focus groups (n=16 parents), each lasting 1.0-1.5 hours were conducted. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results: Generally, parents had limited ADHD-related knowledge prior to their child's diagnosis and perceived prescription medicines indicated for ADHD in a negative context.

Memory was assessed with a set offorced-choice recognition questions once in the misleading interview context and for the children asecond time at home one week later. When participants were instructed to mentally reinstate thecontext of the misleading interview prior to the recognition test, false memory reports occurred moreoften for adults than for children and had a stronger impact on peripheral information than on centralinformation for both 7-year-olds and adults. When 5- and 7-year-olds were tested at home, falsememory reports decreased.

This month’s column continues with that case and demonstrates how behavior rating scales or checklists are another inexpensive and potentially useful source of information. This column shows how to make use of likelihood ratios (how much more likely a disorder is to be present than absent for a given test score in a defined population [Guyatt and Rennie, 2002]) to assess the likelihood of PBD in an individual case. Likelihood ratios are valuable because they may enable a clinician to take a legitimate shortcut and use an easier to administer diagnostic test (here the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) in place of a more time-consuming but definitive test (here the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children [Kaufman et al., 1997]). The specific details of the case have been changed so that the person described is not recognizable. At the time of intake, the biological mother completed the CBCL (Achenbach, 1991; Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). Is CBCL information helpful in assessing for PBD? In Medline, the search terms ‘‘CBCL AND bipolar disorder’’ generate multiple hits, including a meta-analysis of previous studies comparing CBCL scores for cases diagnosed with PBD compared with other children (Mick et al., 2003), along with some more recent studies (Kahana et al., 2003; Youngstrom et al., 2004). The meta-analysis presents mean CBCL clinical syndrome scale T scores in clinical bipolar youth, with the Aggressive Behavior scale being most elevated, followed by Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, and Delinquent Behavior. Mick et al. (2003) propose these scales as a potential ‘‘bipolar profile’’ but do not suggest optimal cutoff scores to differentiate PBD. The more recent articles compared the CBCL subscales with the Externalizing problems broad band score (a composite of several syndrome scales) and found that after controlling for the Externalizing score, none of the other CBCL scales improved the identification rate of PBD (Kahana et al., 2003; Youngstrom et al., 2004). It is worth noting that all published research on PBD to date has used older versions of the CBCL. The current version in clinical use is the 2001 form, which changed some items and reorganized some scales. However, the Externalizing scale score correlates 0.99 between the 1991 and 2001 versions (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001), suggesting that performance should be similar. Overall, based on these findings, it makes sense to focus on the Externalizing score. Consider, therefore, the likelihood ratios associated with low, intermediate, high, and very high Externalizing CBCL scores, broken down separately by age (Youngstrom et al., 2004). This approach examines the performance of multiple segments of the test scores rather than simply dividing the test at one place (as is done when calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the test at a single threshold score) (Guyatt and Rennie, Accepted February 11, 2005.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated online search behavior related to the COVID-19 outbreak and the attitudes of "infodemic monikers" (ie, erroneous information that gives rise to interpretative mistakes, fake news, episodes of racism, etc) circulating in Italy. METHODS: By using Google Trends to explore the internet search activity related to COVID-19 from January to March 2020, article titles from the most read newspapers and government websites were mined to investigate the attitudes of infodemic monikers circulating across various regions and cities in Italy. Search volume values and average peak comparison (APC) values were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: Keywords such as "novel coronavirus," "China coronavirus," "COVID-19," "2019-nCOV," and "SARS-COV-2" were the top infodemic and scientific COVID-19 terms trending in Italy. The top five searches related to health were "face masks," "amuchina" (disinfectant), "symptoms of the novel coronavirus," "health bulletin," and "vaccines for coronavirus." The regions of Umbria and Basilicata recorded a high number of infodemic monikers (APC weighted total >140). Misinformation was widely circulated in the Campania region, and racism-related information was widespread in Umbria and Basilicata. These monikers were frequently searched (APC weighted total >100) in more than 10 major cities in Italy, including Rome. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a growing regional and population-level interest in COVID-19 in Italy.

Using this case study, the relationship between the production of information about environmental problems and external institutions which address them, is examined.

Although, from a technical perspective, it can be regarded as a straight-forward, binary classification problem, the major challenge is the collection of large enough training corpora, since manual annotation of tweets as fake or non-fake news is an expensive and tedious endeavor. In this paper, we discuss a weakly supervised approach, which automatically collects a large-scale, but very noisy training dataset comprising hundreds of thousands of tweets. During collection, we automatically label tweets by their source, i.e., trustworthy or untrustworthy source, and train a classifier on this dataset. We then use that classifier for a different classification target, i.e., the classification of fake and non-fake tweets. Although the labels are not accurate according to the new classification target (not all tweets by an untrustworthy source need to be fake news, and vice versa), we show that despite this unclean inaccurate dataset, it is possible to detect fake news with an F1 score of up to 0.9.', 1363.1737405958802, 9, 0.0270935960591133, 2.8591882414437897e-05), (2157961843, 'Younger Adults Can Be More Suggestible than Older Adults: The Influence of Learning Differences on Misinformation Reporting', 'Tammy A.

As expected, the degree of initial learning influenced age differences in misinformation reporting. That is, when event memory was poorer for older than younger adults (in the criterion learning condition), older adults were more susceptible to misinformation than younger adults. However, when memory of the event was poor (in the one-trial learning condition), the younger adults reported more misled details than the older adults, possibly because the younger adults had better memory for the misleading information.

Using event-related fMRI, 13 boys with ASD and 13 typically developing boys comparable for age and IQ were investigated during encoding of neutral objects presented either with a social (faces) or a non-social (houses) context. A memory paradigm was then applied to identify brain activation patterns associated with encoding of subsequently recollected versus non-recollected objects. On the behavioural level, no significant between-group differences emerged. In particular, no differential effects of context on memory performance were observed. Neurally, however, context-specific group differences were observed in several brain regions.

Neural activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus was positively correlated with memory performance in controls, but negatively in ASD individuals.

In short, structured dsRNA hairpins individual adenosine bases may be targeted specifically and edited with up to one hundred percent efficiency, leading to the production of alternative protein variants. However, the majority of editing events occur within longer stretches of dsRNA formed by pairing of repetitive sequences. Here, many different adenosine bases are potential targets but editing efficiency is usually much lower. Recent work shows that ADAR-mediated RNA editing is also required to prevent aberrant activation of antiviral innate immune sensors that detect viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm.

It is unclear whether non-visual input is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. We recorded smooth pursuit eye movements in 21 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 22 patients with bipolar disorder, and 24 controls. In a foveo-fugal ramp task, the target was either continuously visible or was blanked during movement. We determined peak gain (measuring overall performance), initial eye acceleration (measuring visually driven pursuit), deceleration after target extinction (measuring prediction), eye velocity drifts before onset of target visibility (measuring anticipation), and residual gain during blanking intervals (measuring anticipation and prediction). In both patient groups, initial eye acceleration was decreased and the ability to adjust eye acceleration to increasing target acceleration was impaired. In contrast, neither deceleration nor eye drift velocity was reduced in patients, implying unimpaired non-visual contributions to pursuit drive.

These structures are important to the acquisition of associative knowledge, leading some to theorize that associative learning deficits might be expected, despite the fact that most extant research in ADHD has focused on effortful control. We present 2 studies that examined the acquisition of explicit rule-based (RB) and associative information integration (II) category learning among school-age children with ADHD. METHOD AND RESULTS: In Study 1, we found deficits in both RB and II category learning tasks among children with ADHD (n = 81) versus controls (n = 42). Children with ADHD tended to sort by the more salient but irrelevant dimension (in the RB paradigm) and were unable to acquire a consistent sorting strategy (in the II paradigm). To disentangle whether the deficit was localized to II category learning versus a generalized inability to consider more than 1 stimulus dimension, in Study 2 children completed a conjunctive RB paradigm that required consideration of 2 stimulus dimensions. Children with ADHD (n = 50) continued to underperform controls (n = 33).

Perceived likelihood ratings were also collected. Results showed that the regulation of the plurality option increased accuracy even in the presence of misinformation and highlighted the importance of the perceived likelihood ratings in the decision to select a single or plural answer. In general, the results suggest that better testimonies could be obtained if witnesses are given some control over their answers.

"Cyberdating," as it is called, promises to proffer new possibilities and creativities not found in the real-life world. The multi-billion dollar industry in Internet dating and matching services attests to the popularity of cyberdating. This popularity may be attributable to the Internet\'s flexible accessibility, creative opportunities, and perhaps most importantly, anonymity and new freedoms attending that anonymity. These freedoms remove and disentangle netizens from the moral and social qualms in the face-to-face world and facilitate a "free play" with identity and imagination. However, with the new possibilities of cyberdating come new problems characteristic of this new arena for romance. Misinformation, for instance, has been proved a troubling phenomenon in cyberdating, whose dangers and treacherous nature have been plentifully covered in the popular press. Take a quick a look at the following titles: "When spouses go astray online"; "Man with over 200 online wives"; "Internet romance ends with man jailed in Wales"; and "French woman dies after an Internet romance sours". More dramatic tragedies in cyberdating involve kidnapping, abuse, and even murder. Therefore, of great practicality are studies of the unique features of the medium of the Internet, which engender and implicate new issues and problems for human interaction in the mediated space. This paper begins with an analysis of the media characteristics of cyber space that tend to render information more malleable and the incidence of misinformation more likely. Second, examination will be given of the dual nature of online interaction: misinformation at the Sender\'s end and (dis)trust at the Receiver\'s end. Third, this work investigates how trust is gained and lost in cyberdating. What principles and behaviors affect the operation of trust in cyberdating? Do online encounters commence with assumed trust or must trust be acquired in the process of deepened interactions? With the citation of a reported case of fraud in cyberdating, the fourth section of this work illustrates and analyzes the process of misinformation detection. The paper ends with practical implications for cyberdaters and their relational development. The Internet as a Unique Medium for Dating Based on the fundamental premise of McLuhan\'s (1964) postulate that "the medium is the message", this section discusses the media characteristics of the Internet. Specifically, the following factors of the Internet as a medium will be examined: immediacy of feedback, multiple cues, language variety, and personal focus. This examination reveals that the media characteristics of the Internet facilitate easier manipulation of information and increase the incidence of misinformation. Medium as the Message When a new technology emerges, its form merits careful study, for "the medium is the message", as admonished by McLuhan (1964). A medium exerts influence on the society by not only playing a role in its delivered content, but by way of the very mechanism of its media characteristics. McLuhan illustrated this point with the invention of the light bulb. A light bulb does not possess or deliver content in the way of a newspaper article or television program. It has no content, but it creates space. The space created by the light bulb offers new possibilities; for instance, it enables people to work in what otherwise would be complete darkness. In this sense, a light bulb, by its mere presence, creates a new environment or medium, with new possibilities and new influences (McLuhan, 1964, p. 8). Similarly, the invention of the Internet does not merely give a new tool for information collection and circulation; it creates a virtual world that awakens and develops new dimensions of human interactions, revises the sense of authenticity, and excites new imaginations. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2598230052, 'Yellow fever outbreaks and Twitter: Rumors and misinformation.', 'Yeimer Ortiz-Martínez (University of Sucre), Luisa F.

At subleading orders, analogous terms in general provide obstructions to the integrability of the corresponding charges. Since the subleading terms are defined close to null infinity, but vanish actually at infinity, the analogous obstructions are not associated with genuine Bondi news.

The clinical impact of endodontic posts compared with post-free restoration with or without ferrule support was not systematically reviewed so far. It was assumed that the effect of an endodontic post compared with a post-free restoration can be evaluated only when at the same time a ferrule or no-ferrule situation was clinically compared. Methods The specific PICO question was as follows: Patient: adults with sufficient endodontic treatment needing a core or post; Intervention: post-endodontic treatment using posts with or without ferrule; Comparison: post-endodontic treatment without posts with or without ferrule; Outcomes: failure rates of post/core complexes with or without ferrule support. A Medline search was performed via PubMed in June 2017 using relevant electronic databases. Additionally, hand search was performed.

For example, a claim is not robust if small perturbations to its parameters can change its conclusions significantly. This framework allows us to formulate practical fact-checking tasks—reverse-engineering vague claims, and countering questionable claims—as computational problems.

METHODS: We reviewed articles published prior to July 31, 2015 on the most shared/heavily trafficked mainstream media websites of 2014 using the names of patients from two highly publicized brain death cases, "Jahi McMath" and "Marlise Munoz." RESULTS: We reviewed 208 unique articles. The subject was referred to as being "alive" or on "life support" in 72% (149) of the articles, 97% (144) of which also described the subject as being brain dead. A definition of brain death was provided in 4% (9) of the articles. Only 7% (14) of the articles noted that organ support should be discontinued after brain death declaration unless a family has agreed to organ donation. Reference was made to well-known cases of patients in persistent vegetative states in 16% (34) of articles and 47% (16) of these implied both patients were in the same clinical state. CONCLUSIONS: Mainstream media provides poor education to the public on brain death.

Recently, studies examining the role of brain hemisphere activity in the Navon task have indicated that the processing of global and local information can be, respectively, attributed to the right and left hemispheres. Moreover, many neuroimaging researches have revealed that certain core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to dysfunction of right hemisphere. These findings imply that global interference will be substantially less evident, and possibly even replaced by local interference in ADHD. The present study compared the performance of children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder of the inattentive type (ADHD-I) in the processing of global and local information to examine the local interference hypothesis in ADHD. An ADHD-I group ( n \xa0=\xa015) and a paired control group ( n \xa0=\xa019) completed tasks using two versions of the Navon task, one requiring divided attention, in which no information was given to participants regarding the level at which a target would appear, and the other requiring selective attention, in which participants were instructed to attend to either the local or the global level. The results showed that children with ADHD-I exhibited local interference, regardless of which attention procedure was used. These results support the weak right hemisphere hypothesis in ADHD, and provide evidence against the deficit hypotheses for ADHD in the DSM-IV criteria [29] , which postulates that inattention symptoms may manifest as a failure to provide close attention to details.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (1991763899, 'A SOURCE OF BOTANICAL MISINFORMATION.', 'Edgar T.

Methods: We administered the selfreferent encoding task and the dot-probe task to adolescents with bipolar I disorder (BD, n = 35) and a demographically similar healthy comparison group (HC, n = 25) at baseline, and at a 1-year follow-up in a subset of this cohort ( n= 22 per group). Results: At both baseline and 1-year follow-up, there were significant interactions of group (BD, HC) and valence of stimulus (positive, negative adjective) on endorsement and recall of self-referent adjectives. HC adolescents endorsed and recalled more positive self-referent adjectives at baseline and follow-up while adolescents with BD endorsed and recalled more negative self-referent adjectives at baseline but not follow-up. Over time, depression symptomatology was associated with impaired memory for positive self-referent adjectives. There were no group differences in attentional bias at either time points. Conclusions: Adolescents with BD exhibit bias away from endorsement and recall of positive adjectives, which remained stable over time and independent of mood state.

It is often observed that news stories are first broken in Twitter space and then the electronic and print media take them up. However, the distributed structure and lack of moderation in Twitter compounded with the temptation of posting a news worthy story early on Twitter, makes the veracity of information (tweet) a major issue. Our work is an attempt to solve this problem by providing a approach to detect misinformation/rumors on Twitter in real-time automatically. We define a rumor as any information which is circulating in Twitter space and is not in agreement with the information from a credible source. For establishing credibility, our approach is based on the premise that verified News Channel accounts on Twitter would furnish more credible information as compared to the naive unverified account of user (public at large). Our approach has four key steps. Firstly, we extract live streaming tweets corresponding to Twitter trends, identify topics being talked about in each trend based on clustering using hashtags and then collect tweets for each topic. Secondly, we segregate the tweets for each topic based on whether its tweeter is a verified news channel or a general user. Thirdly, we calculate and compare the contextual and sentiment mismatch between tweets comprising of the same topic from verified Twitter accounts of News Channels and other unverified (general) users using semantic and sentiment analysis of the tweets. Lastly, we label the topic as a rumor based on the value of mismatch ratio, which reflects the degree of discrepancy between the news and public on that topic. Results show that a large amount of topics can be flagged as suspicious using this approach without involvement of any manual inspection. In order to validate our proposed algorithm, we implement a prototype called The Twitter Grapevine which targets rumor detection in the Indian domain. The prototype shows how a user can leverage this implementation to monitor the detected rumors using activity timeline, maps and tweet feed. User can also report the rumor as incorrect which can then be updated after manual inspection.', 56.619047619047606, 5, 0.0727272727272727, 2.33246842017076e-05), (2125523073, 'Evaluation of an Information Resource for Parents of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Janice Mulligan (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.), Lee Steel , Radha MacCulloch , David Nicholas ', 2010, 13, 'This study sought to evaluate a newly created information resource book for parents of children newly diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder entitled Autism Spectrum Disorder: Information for Parents.

The former refers to the distorting memorial effects of misleading information that is presented after valid event encoding; the latter refers to information that is initially presented as true but subsequently turns out to be false and continues to affect memory and reasoning despite the correction. In two experiments, using a paradigm that merges elements from both traditions, we investigated the role of presentation order and recency when two competing causal explanations for an event are presented and one is subsequently retracted. Theoretical accounts of misinformation effects make diverging predictions regarding the roles of presentation order and recency. A recency account—derived from time-based models of memory and reading comprehension research suggesting efficient situation model updating—predicts that the more recently presented cause should have a stronger influence on memory and reasoning. By contrast, a primacy account—derived from primacy effects in impression formation and story recall as well as findings of inadequate memory updating—predicts that the initially presented cause should be dominant irrespective of temporal factors. Results indicated that (1) a cause’s recency, rather than its position (i.e., whether it was presented first or last) determined the emphasis that people place on it in their later reasoning, with more recent explanations being preferred; and (2) a retraction was equally effective whether it invalidated the first or the second cause, as long as the cause’s recency was held constant.

This study applied a machine-learning method to classify MDD and control groups by incorporating data from serum proteomic analysis and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis for the identification of novel peripheral biomarkers. Methods The study subjects consisted of 25 drug-free female MDD patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. First, quantitative serum proteome profiles were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using pooled serum samples from 10 patients and 10 controls. Next, candidate proteins were quantified with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in 50 subjects. We also analyzed 22 linear and nonlinear HRV parameters in 50 subjects. Finally, we identified a combined biomarker panel consisting of proteins and HRV indexes using a support vector machine with recursive feature elimination. Results A separation between MDD and control groups was achieved using five parameters (apolipoprotein B, group-specific component, ceruloplasmin, RMSSD, and SampEn) at 80.1% classification accuracy. A combination of HRV and proteomic data achieved better classification accuracy. Conclusions A high classification accuracy can be achieved by combining multimodal information from heart rate dynamics and serum proteomics in MDD.

For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the influence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identification of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and find that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming.

We performed a sentiment analysis to identify emotional valence and predominant emotions. We conducted topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time.\n\nResults: We evaluated 126,049 tweets from 53,196 unique users. The hourly number of COVID-19-related tweets starkly increased from January 21, 2020 onward. Nearly half (49.5%) of all tweets expressed fear and nearly 30% expressed surprise.

Methods: A 39 question, paper-based, anonymous survey, translated into 12 languages, was completed by 1222 patients in 17 countries as a convenience sample between March 2014 and January 2016. All patients had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder from a psychiatrist. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations to account for correlated data. Results: 976 (81 % of 1212 valid responses) of the patients used the Internet, and of these 750 (77 %) looked for information on bipolar disorder. When looking online for information, 89 % used a computer rather than a smartphone, and 79 % started with a general search engine.

Methods A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 2020 using keywords ‘coronavirus’ and ‘COVID-19’, and the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and non-visual, exceeding 1\u2009hour in duration, live and unrelated to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the source, content and characteristics of included videos. The primary outcome was usability and reliability of videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score (CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA (mJAMA) scores. Results Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, totalling 257\u2009804\u2009146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos contained non-factual information, totalling 62\u2009042\u2009609 views.

We found significant effects of the PGR-BD score on task-related activation irrespective of diagnostic group. There was a negative association between the PGR-BD score and activation in the visual association cortex during facial affect processing. In contrast, the PGR-BD score was associated with failure to deactivate the ventromedial prefrontal region of the default mode network during working memory processing. These results are consistent with the threshold-liability model of BD, and demonstrate the usefulness of the PGR-BD score in identifying brain functional alternations associated with vulnerability to BD. Additionally, our findings suggest that the polygenic architecture of BD is not regionally confined but impacts on the task-dependent recruitment of multiple brain regions.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2029633391, 'Avoiding misinformation : Reinstating target modality', 'Paul Abeles , John Morton ', 1999, 12, 'Explanations of the misinformation effect were considered in an experiment using a reversed eyewitness suggestibility design (Lindsay & Johnson, 1989b).

Through various manifestations, satirical fake news has incited a much-needed revaluation of journalism\'s relationship to politics and civic culture. As Jeffrey P. Jones observes in Entertaining Politics: Satiric Television and Political Engagement, critical discussions of emergent forms of satire like fake news (Jones\' terminology) have appeared in large part due to "a fundamental change in political communication in America" (7). Whereas entertainment television has traditionally shied away from the "serious" realm of politics (only occasionally exploring political themes and subjects), politics now forms an integral part of entertainment programming. This shift, Jones argues, has been instrumental in blurring the boundaries between serious and entertaining discourse(s), placing politics squarely (and perhaps uncomfortably) at the center of new debates surrounding the function and value of entertainment in civic culture. It is important to illuminate the formal and rhetorical elements fake news deploys in its sustained critiques of news media, devices that have significantly enabled political satirists to reframe the representation of meaningful issues in the public sphere. This process of re-presentation functions through the form\'s juxtaposition of factual and fictional elements, a process that highlights the discrepancies, omissions, and general flaws in logic that mark everyday news reportage. The Iraq War and the 2008 American Presidential Election To crystallize my argument, this essay examines fake news\' re-presentation of political discourse through two critical frames, the Iraq War and the 2008 American presidential election, issues heavily reported in mainstream news media that continue to attract significant attention from various scholars. Recent scholarship on the Iraq War addresses a number of disparate issues: news coverage and propaganda (Dimaggio 2009; Melkote 2009; Moeller 2004;), politics/political theory (Hallenberg & Karlsson 2005; Lee 2010; Zizek 2004), democratic politics (Danchev & MacMillan 2005), feminist critique (Jeffreys 2007; Oliver 2007; Sjoberg 2006), human casualties (Burnham 2006), narrative (Ringmar 2006), capitalism (Klein 2007), and economics (Stiglitz & Bilmes 2008), to cite but a few. Elsewhere, scholarship on the 2008 presidential election has explored issues related to race (Sinclair-Chapman & Price 2008), gender (Whitaker 2008; Lawrence & Rose 2010), social change (Harlow 2009), political campaigning and advertising (Panagopoulos 2009), campaign financing reform (see Lessig\'s Change Congress), education (Carter 2011), economics (Halcoussis et al. 2009), and social media (Hendricks & Denton 2010). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, these two separate phenomena deserve examination because these issues consistently appear in a broad range of satirical fake news examples. Examples here come almost exclusively from The Onion and The Daily Show due in large part to their prolific output and strong emphasis on these two issues.1 The following discussion of these highly charged political events highlights how satirical fake news coverage shifts and expands the representation of larger sets of issues in the public sphere. Satirical fake news narratives add critical complexity to dominant forms of political discourse through their reflexive engagement with contemporary journalism. The following essay examines how political satirists challenge and subvert the codes and conventions of traditional journalism through a number of satiric, ironic, and parodie appropriations, in the interests of revealing the inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and failures of mainstream media reportage.

One possible antidote to misinformation is fact checking which, however, does not always stop rumors from spreading further, owing to selective exposure and our limited attention. What are the conditions under which factual verification are effective at containing the spreading of misinformation?

Akinwumi ', 2008, 12, 'In the commercial parlance, African print is a general term employed by the European textile firms in Africa to identify fabrics which are machine-printed using wax resins and dyes in order to achieve batik effect on both sides of the cloth, and a term for those imitating or achieving a resemblance of the wax type effects. They bear names such as abada, Ankara, Real English Wax, Veritable Java Print, Guaranteed Dutch Java Hollandis, Uniwax, ukpo and chitenge. Using the term \'African Print\' for all the brand names mentioned above is only acceptable to its producers and marketers, but to a critical mind, the term is a misnomer and therefore suspicious because its origin and most of its design characteristics are not African. Hence, Jefferson (1974:95) disregarded the prints as authentically African, but rather European "African Cloths", however, there has been no account made on why these cloths are neither African cloths, nor African prints. As the design content has been in contention, attempts to redress the situation started a while ago. For example, Littrell provided a blue-print on how to improve it. She called for the viewpoints of designers, distributors, sellers and consumers so that their ideas could be conceptualized as motifs for creating a possible new design order (Littrell 1977). Hence I will focus on some Nigerian universities and colleges with art departments and has incorporated African print designing and its studio production into their curriculum from the 1970\'s. In a cursory examination of fabric designs representing two reputable art departments, studentdesigners from the departments sheepishly adopted the design format associated with the European and Asian textile firms (the works will be shown later). The way forward here is the consideration of another possible design blue-print, is the focus of this paper, although production technique is not in contention, hence least discussed in this paper. Consequently, I will investigate the origins of African prints and the roles played by early European textile merchants and their African textile trader-collaborators in producing and exporting modified Indonesian wax batik to Africa in the name of \'African print\'. Second, I examine the design content of what were produced for the African consumers at the beginning, at later times and in contemporary time to discover whether the prints are dominantly of Indonesian aesthetics blended with Dutch, Indian, Chinese, Arab and European influences or not. And finally, I argue for another alternative design model to Littrell\'s; first by exploring certain features of African indigenous textile designs and second by examining Macquet\'s themes on Africanity (1972) as sources of inspiration for providing a new blue-print. Africanity: Macquet\'s Themes The reasons for the choice of Macquet\'s themes are significant. The Javanese, Indian, Chinese and Arab artists whose works were adopted for African print themes/designs seemed to have had tremendous knowledge and understanding of their respective worldview which has impacted on their works (see figs. 1 and 2). In like manner, the acquisition of knowledge and understanding of African worldview otherwise termed here as \'Africanity\' is imperative for African/Africanist designers to serve as a platform from which authentic African print ideas can be generated and produced; going beyond the ideas expressed about the nature of Black Africa not extinct in recent works (Bohannan 1964, Davidson 1969, Jackson 1970, Stuckey 1972, Diop 1974, Williams 1974, Diop 1978, Asante 1987, Ojo-Ade: 1996). Thus, Macquet classified them under the rubric of Africanity, defining it as the unique cultural heritage shared by many of the peoples of black Africa (Macquet 1972). And in Macquet\'s exploration of cultural unit, she observed social, historical and geographical bonds that link the Black peoples of Africa in the areas of kinship and marriage institutions, political organizations, religious beliefs and worldviews (Macquet 1972:6). …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2026111741, 'Recollection of negative information in posttraumatic stress disorder', 'Géraldine Tapia (Université Bordeaux Segalen), David Clarys (University of Poitiers), Aurélia Bugaiska (Laboratory for the Study of Learning and Development, Université de Dijon, Dijon, France), Wissam El-Hage (François Rabelais University)', 2012, 12, ': The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with the effects of emotional valence on recall processes in recognition memory.

In this replication study, we carefully examined the role of informant data in ascertaining OCD in relatives. METHOD: We interviewed 112 relatives of 57 OCD patients and 115 relatives of 41 not ill controls predominantly by telephone. Additional analyses included a combined sample of relatives about whom any diagnostic information was available (228 OCD and 239 controls). To examine the contribution of proband information about relatives, we considered two sets of best-estimate diagnoses. First, we ascertained best-estimate diagnoses for relatives using information from direct interviews and from all informants except the proband. Then, we re-diagnosed relatives based on all available information, including reports from the proband about their relatives. RESULTS: When relative diagnoses were derived without the benefit of proband informant reports, no evidence of familial OCD transmission was found. When diagnoses were made including information from the proband about the relative, evidence of familial OCD was found, but only when the diagnostic threshold was lowered to include cases with probable OCD or OCD symptoms. Other diagnoses (generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, drug use disorder) were also higher among OCD relatives. CONCLUSIONS: This second study provides less robust support for familial transmission of OCD. Evidence for familial transmission of OCD was found only when diagnoses were made using information from the affected proband about their relatives. Taken in context of past findings, our own inconsistent results suggest that OCD may be heterogeneous with regard to familial transmission.

This concern has drawn the attention of the research community on developing mechanisms to detect misinformation. The task of misinformation detection consists of classifying whether a claim is True or False. Most research concentrates on developing machine learning models, such as neural networks, that outputs a single value in order to predict the veracity of a claim. One of the major problem faced by these models is the inability of representing the uncertainty of the prediction, which is due incomplete or finite available information about the claim being examined. We address this problem by proposing a Bayesian deep learning model. The Bayesian model outputs a distribution used to represent both the prediction and its uncertainty. In addition to the claim content, we also encode auxiliary information given by people's replies to the claim. First, the model encodes a claim to be verified, and generate a prior belief distribution from which we sample a latent variable. Second, the model encodes all the people's replies to the claim in a temporal order through a Long Short Term Memory network in order to summarize their content. This summary is then used to update the prior belief generating the posterior belief. Moreover, in order to train this model, we develop a Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes algorithm to approximate the analytically intractable posterior distribution.

In Japan, tobacco use is still often regarded as an issue of manners rather than an issue of health. Information about tobacco is available, but may not always be accurate. We explored what information Japanese consumers might access by reading popular Japanese books about tobacco. Methods: We searched Amazon.com Japan using the term “Tobacco”, identifying the top 12 books by “relevance” and “bestselling.” We eliminated duplicates and books not concerned with tobacco use and classified the remaining books as pro-smoking, anti-smoking, or neutral. We reviewed the pro-smoking books, published 2004-2009, and analyzed examples of misinformation by theme. Results: Pro-smoking popular books conveyed five types of misinformation: doubt about science; suggestions that smoking increased health, longevity, virility, etc.; trivializing tobacco’s effects; attacking public health advocates/ authorities; and linking tobacco use with authenticity, history, or civil rights. At least one book was authored by a former Japan Tobacco employee; another used a popular Japan Tobacco advertising phrase. Conclusions: Creating doubt and confusion about tobacco serves tobacco industry interests and re-creates a strategy developed by US tobacco interests more than 40 years ago.

Little is known regarding factors that influence storage practices and willingness to engage in means safety. Methods Utilizing Amazon's Mechanical Turk program, we recruited an online sample of 300 adults living in the US who own at least one firearm. Firearm storage practices and openness to means safety measures were assessed using items designed for this study. Data were collected and analyzed in 2017. Results Firearms stored in non-secure locations and without a locking device were associated with lower beliefs in the relationship between firearm storage and suicide risk. Fearlessness about death moderated the association between current secure versus non-secure storage and beliefs regarding firearm storage and suicide risk, in that storage practices and beliefs were more strongly related at higher levels of fearlessness about death. For both secure and locked storage of a firearm, there was a significant indirect effect of current storage practices on willingness to engage in means safety in the future through current beliefs regarding the relationship between firearm storage and suicide risk. Unsafe storage practices were largely associated with an unwillingness to store firearms more safely or to allow a trusted peer to temporarily store the firearm outside the home in order to prevent their own or someone else's suicide.

In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers’ concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 –common information correction, and Condition 2 –recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public’s concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults \r\nA statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry’s response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66).

Recently, studies examining the role of brain hemisphere activity in the Navon task have indicated that the processing of global and local information can be, respectively, attributed to the right and left hemispheres. Moreover, many neuroimaging researches have revealed that certain core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to dysfunction of right hemisphere. These findings imply that global interference will be substantially less evident, and possibly even replaced by local interference in ADHD. The present study compared the performance of children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder of the inattentive type (ADHD-I) in the processing of global and local information to examine the local interference hypothesis in ADHD. An ADHD-I group (n = 15) and a paired control group (n = 19) completed tasks using two versions of the Navon task, one requiring divided attention, in which no information was given to participants regarding the level at which a target would appear, and the other requiring selective attention, in which participants were instructed to attend to either the local or the global level. The results showed that children with ADHD-I exhibited local interference, regardless of which attention procedure was used.

Gynecologic cancers have become one of the most serious threats to women's health in China. With the widespread use of social media, an increasing number of individuals have employed social media to produce, seek, and share cancer-related information. However, health information on social media is not always accurate. Health, and especially cancer-related, misinformation has been widely spread on social media, which can affect individuals' attitudinal and behavioral responses to cancer. Objective The aim of this study was to examine the nature and diffusion of gynecologic cancer-related misinformation on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Methods A total of 2691 tweets related to 2 gynecologic cancers-breast cancer and cervical cancer-posted on Weibo from June 2015 to June 2016 were extracted using the Python Web Crawler. Two medical school graduate students with expertise in gynecologic diseases were recruited to code the tweets to differentiate between true information and misinformation as well as to identify the types of falsehoods. The diffusion characteristics of gynecologic cancer-related misinformation were compared with those of the true information. Results While most of the gynecologic cancer-related tweets provided medically accurate information, approximately 30% of them were found to contain misinformation. Furthermore, it was found that tweets about cancer treatment contained a higher percentage of misinformation than prevention-related tweets. Nevertheless, the prevention-related misinformation diffused significantly more broadly and deeply than true information on social media. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest the need for controlling and reducing the cancer-related misinformation on social media with the efforts from both service providers and medical professionals.

These spectra were analyzed by principal component and discriminant analysis for pattern recognition. Materials investigated were two strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, one of which produced the tdh toxin, two Salmonella enterica serotypes, a biological mosquito control product containing spores of Bacillus thuringiensis, and several white to off-white powders (which could be used as hoax materials), such as flour, corn starch, methyl cellulose, and xanthan gum.

Gostin ', 2014, 10, "In early 2011, a Pakistani doctor, Shakil Afridi, went door-to-door promising to deliver hepatitis B vaccines in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In reality, the CIA had recruited Dr. Afridi to gather DNA samples as a prelude to the assassination of Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader. (Dr. Afridi was later sentenced to prison for colluding with the CIA.) That deception fueled a widespread distrust of vaccine campaigns, critically damaging the global poliomyelitis eradication program. Shortly after bin Laden's assassination, senior Taliban commanders banned polio eradication in the most troubled areas of Pakistan—South and North Waziristan—until US drone strikes ended: “In the garb of these vaccination campaigns, the US and its allies are running their spying networks.”1\r\n\r\nThe Pakistani government, which seldom is a full and willing partner of the United States, waivered in its resolve to eradicate polio. It ordered Save the Children personnel to leave the country, leaving children unvaccinated. Public backlash has persisted, threatening foreign and community health workers. In March 2014, Salma Farooqi, a mother of 4, was abducted, tortured, and killed for offering polio vaccines—just one of the more than 30 female health workers killed in Pakistan since 2012. Scores of others have been murdered, leading the United Nations to temporarily withdraw its polio eradication staff in December 2012. Fearful parents are preventing health workers from vaccinating their children. (In a sign of hope, though, the Afghan Taliban last year renounced violence against vaccine workers, and earlier this year the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan distanced itself from prominent attacks on polio vaccinators.)\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 2014, the Obama administration formally declared an end to its use of vaccine campaigns as a ruse for spy operations. Responding 16 months after receiving a letter from American public health school deans, the White House said that since August 2013, US policy has not allowed the CIA to use vaccination programs, workers, or genetic materials gathered from immunizations for intelligence purposes. But the White House did not offer a public apology, despite violating the long-standing norm of strictly separating humanitarian assistance from military and intelligence operations.\r\n\r\nThe harms already produced are palpable. Of the 115 polio cases reported this year (as of July 9), 90 were in Pakistan. (http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx). In addition, cases in Afghanistan, Iraq, and war-torn Syria are genetically linked to Waziristan, demonstrating the deep connections among terrorism, political instability, and public health. Nigeria, as well, is a polio-endemic area of global concern; in February 2014, the Islamist militant group Boko Haram shot dead at least 9 women administering polio vaccinations in northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nThe CIA's ploy created political cover for militants seeking to exploit preexisting fears. Disinformation campaigns, for example, have linked polio vaccination campaigns to Western plots to sterilize Muslims.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that depletion of serotonin reserves by tryptophan depletion affects emotional information processing in susceptible individuals. METHODS: The effect of tryptophan (vs placebo) depletion on processing of Ekman emotional faces was compared in impulsive aggressive personality disordered, male and female adults with normal controls. All subjects were free of psychotropic medications, medically healthy, nondepressed, and substance free. Additionally, subjective mood state and vital signs were monitored. RESULTS: For emotion recognition, a significant interaction of Aggression × Drug × Sex (F1, 31 = 7.687, P = 0.009) was found, with male normal controls but not impulsive aggressive males showing increased recognition of fear. For intensity ratings of emotional faces, a significant interaction was discovered of Drug × Group × Sex (F1, 31 = 5.924, P = 0.021), with follow-up tests revealing that males with intermittent explosive disorder tended to increase intensity ratings of angry faces after tryptophan depletion. Additionally, tryptophan depletion was associated with increased heart rate in all subjects, and increased intensity of the subjective emotional state of "anger" in impulsive aggressive subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with clinically relevant levels of impulsive aggression may be susceptible to effects of serotonergic depletion on emotional information processing, showing a tendency to exaggerate their impression of the intensity of angry expressions and to report an angry mood state after tryptophan depletion. This may reflect heightened sensitivity to the effects of serotonergic dysregulation, and suggests that what underlies impulsive aggression is either supersensitivity to serotonergic disturbances or susceptibility to fluctuations in central serotonergic availability.

In addition, Experiment 2 showed that retrieval warnings to disregard the misinformation were just as effective in older adults as compared with younger adults at reducing the reporting of misleading information. Finally, both experiments showed that across the multiple retrieval stages of the Cognitive Interview, the final retrieval stage is roughly half as effective for older adults relative to younger adults at eliciting previously unreported information.

In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly. Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries. METHODS: Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed. RESULTS: Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination. Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak. Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones.

With the exploration of specific tumor antigens such as NY-ESO-1, which is expressed in ovarian carcinoma and other malignancies, the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines has been pursued initiating the era of personalized anti-cancer medicine. Almost at the same time, the adoptive transfer of genetically modified autologous tumor-reactive T-cells occurred, but response rates in ovarian carcinoma were disappointing.

It demonstrates that the emergence of poverty as a domestic and international public policy issue in the 1960s was closely linked to anxieties about racialized violence in American cities and wars of insurgency in the global South. In doing so, it traces how programs of pacification, both at home and abroad, sought to deal with delinquent youth, to marry policing to economic development, and to grapple with poverty and insecurity. Such a global view provides new insights into American-style community development, specifically how a double system of pacification was an integral part of this approach to urban policy. By focusing on an important precursor to the War on Poverty, the Ford Foundation’s Gray Areas program, the essay also highlights how the problem of poverty came to be territorialized not only in the city but specifically in a unit understood as community. However, “community” was a space of contestation. Community action was rapidly transformed into programs of community development, especially those animated by the ethos of self-help. But, in cities like Oakland, the first of the Gray Areas cities, and described as a “racial tinderbox,” the bureaucracy of poverty became the platform for radical visions and practices of self-determination, notably by the Black Panther Party. Understood in this way, community is a key site for the analysis of liberal government. In particular, urban policy mandates such as community development and community participation reveal the enduring contradictions between ideologies of self-help and struggles for self-determination.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2949729647, 'Trends in the Diffusion of Misinformation on Social Media', 'Hunt Allcott (New York University), Matthew Gentzkow (Stanford University), Chuan Yu (Stanford University)', 2018, 9, 'We measure trends in the diffusion of misinformation on Facebook and Twitter between January 2015 and July 2018.

Inspired by the principles of multi-view learning which utilizes information from multiple views to enhance object representation, we propose a novel multiple network based framework to enhance the representation of functional connectivity networks by fusing the common and complementary information conveyed in multiple networks. Specifically, four functional connectivity networks corresponding to the four adjacent values of regularization parameter are generated via a sparse regression model with group constraint ( l2,1 -norm), to enhance the common intrinsic topological structure and limit the error rate caused by different views. To obtain a set of more meaningful and discriminative features, we propose using a modified version of weighted clustering coefficients to quantify the subtle differences of each group-sparse network at local level.

Overall, a misinformation effect was found for both items. The warning strongly reduced the misinformation effect, but only for the central item.

This occurs because the prior mean, which can be thought of as a weighted pseudo-observation, is an outlier with respect to the real observations. While this situation will be easily noticed and avoided in simple models, in more complicated models, the effect can be easily overlooked.

Based on the attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with the largest attention values for misinformation identification. The attention mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention is the calculated-based textual features of each microblog.

Our tool has been used for monitoring content during the 2018 Brazilian general election and was one of the major sources for estimating the spread of misinformation and helping fact-checking efforts.', 0.0, 3, 0.0, 2.5750863996401698e-05), (3014820715, 'Impact of Rumors and Misinformation on COVID-19 in Social Media.', 'Samia Tasnim (Texas A&M University), Mahbub Hossain (Texas A&M University), Hoimonty Mazumder (Save the Children)', 2020, 8, 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has not only caused significant challenges for health systems all over the globe but also fueled the surge of numerous rumors, hoaxes, and misinformation, regarding the etiology, outcomes, prevention, and cure of the disease.

To do so, it draws on in-depth interviews with senior journalists based in London and Sydney, providing topical insights into how these practitioners understand their role in an era of “fake news”.

The theory assumes a population of available stimuli consisting of sets of cues which are either irrelevant or relevant to the problem solution.

Restle\'s cue validity (V) is represented by the following equation, Restle assumed that a relevant cue which is reinforced less than 100% of the trials has validity which will be less than unity.

We explored this question using data from five previous memory conformity experiments. The results provide evidence of an association between speaking order and memory conformity, such that people who spoke first in a discussion were misled less often than people who did not. These results build on previous research by demonstrating that the association could not have been caused by differences in opportunities to be misled.

Grant (DePaul University), Linda V. Knight (DePaul University), Theresa A. Steinbach (Informing Science Institute)', 2007, 8, 'Introduction Goal of the Research Numerous researchers have indicated that a particular piece of misinformation, the perception of Information Technology (IT) professionals as being geeks and loners, may be one of many explanations for the under-representation of women in Information Technology. In particular, Jepson and Perl (2002) identified a nerdy image of IT people as one of six reasons that girls do not choose IT careers. Hazzan and Levy (2006) identified a "geeky" and loner image as one of three factors discouraging women from IT careers, positing that women are more likely to be interested in careers involving more interaction with people. Margolis and Fisher (2002) suggested that women are more likely to be affected by the geek stereotype than men are, and thus, when women do not experience an intense obsession with computers, they are more likely to contemplate whether they really belong in the IT field. Eglash (2002) described the geek identity as not only a gender but also a race concern that acts as a gatekeeper and paradox in the participation of science and technology as it potentially hinders diversity. The purpose of this research was to determine if girls in the United States, ages sixteen through eighteen, at the age when they are making university and career choices, do indeed view IT professionals in this negative way. Significance of the Issue The geek/loner issue is important for multiple reasons. The predicted growth of IT jobs in the United States (Hecker, 2005), the shortage of IT professionals (McGee, 2005), and the under-representation of women in the IT field have raised serious concern regarding the US technology workforce in the 21st century (Camp, 1997; Grant, Knight, & Steinbach, 2006; Holzer, 2006; Lazowska, 2002; Sanders, 2005). According to the employment outlook for 2004-2014 by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (Hecker, 2005), computer and mathematical science occupations are projected to increase 30.7 percent, an additional 967,000 jobs. Of the 30 fastest-growing occupations during this time, six are in computer-related disciplines: network systems and data communications analysts, computer application software engineers, computer systems software engineers, network and computer systems administrators, database administrators, and computer systems analysts. A 2005 study by the Society for Information Management (cited in McGee, 2005) lists critical shortages in IT project management and "business domain" experts for 2005-2008. McGee (2005) cites two reasons for the shortage of IT professionals. A 10 percent decline from 10 or 15 years ago in the number of students majoring in technology-related degrees has been estimated. Some universities report upwards of a 50 percent decrease in enrollment in these degrees. As baby-boomer professionals begin retiring, an expertise shortage will exacerbate the situation. There has been an 18.5 percent decline in the percentage of women in the IT workforce since 1996 (Information Technology Association of America, 2005). Women composed 32.4 percent of the total IT workforce in 2004. A third of these women are in administrative occupations such as "data entry keyer" and "computer operator." If these administrative occupations are removed from the calculations, women IT professionals and managers fall to 24.9 percent, virtually the same percentage as in 2002. Over the past two decades, the number of young women in the US pursuing careers in Computer and Information Sciences (CIS) has significantly decreased. The National Center of Educational Statistics (2005) reported that in 1984, 32,439 undergraduate students received bachelor\'s degrees in CIS. Men represented 20,416 of the total (63 percent), while women were 12,023 (37 percent). However, in 2004, 59,488 students received their bachelor\'s degrees in CIS of which 44,585 (75 percent) were men and 14,903 (25 percent) were women. Thus, the percentage of CIS majors who are female has dropped from 37 percent in 1984 to just 25 percent in 2004. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2034711109, 'Management misinformation systems', 'Russell L.

Olatunji , Kevin Connolly , Jeffrey M. Lohr , Lisa S. Elwood ', 2008, 8, 'The present study examined the accessibility of harm and safety information regarding threat-relevant and threat-irrelevant stimuli in analogue contamination-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) participants. High OCD participants (N = 24) and low OCD participants (N = 27) generated lists of reasons why four specific situations (using a public restroom, going cliff diving, reading at the library, going to the museum) might be harmful and why they might be safe. Results revealed that, in comparison to the low OCD participants, high OCD participants were able to generate significantly more items on why using a public restroom might be harmful and significantly fewer items on why using a public restroom might be safe. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in their ability to generate items regarding harm and safety for other situations. Furthermore, number of safety items predicted contamination group status independent of harm items. Content analysis of the harm items generated for using a public restroom revealed concerns primarily related to contagion and disease. Accordingly, the number of items generated for using a public restroom showed a marginal association with disgust levels. The implications of these findings for understanding cognitive biases underlying contamination-related OCD are discussed. Keywords: contamination; OCD; harm; safety; disgust; fear Contamination concerns are the most common theme associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; Rachman & Hodgson, 1980; Rasmussen & Eisen, 1992; Rasmussen & Tsuang, 1986). Ritualistic neutralizing behaviors (e.g., washing) associated with contamination concerns in OCD serve a negatively reinforcing function because distress elicited by the obsessions is temporarily alleviated (Rachman, 1994, 2004). As with other anxiety conditions, the clinical presentation of contamination-based OCD would predict differences in the processing of threat-relevant information. Indeed, individuals with contamination-related OCD may avoid situations and stimuli largely because of inflated expectations of disease and infection (Rachman, 1994; Rachman & Shafran, 1998). Avoidance in contamination-based OCD may also reflect heightened vigilance for stimuli in the environment that may facilitate the acquisition of deadly infection and disease. For example, Tata, Leibowitz, Prunty, Cameron, and Pickering (1996) found that OCD patients with contamination concerns displayed significantly more vigilance for contamination-related words (e.g., bacteria) on a modified "dot-probe" task compared to a mood-matched high trait anxious control group. Cognitive models of psychopathology propose that anxiety disorders are characterized by hypervigilance for threatening information, and a considerable body of literature has supported this notion (Williams, Watts, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1997). This hypervigilance has been interpreted as a tendency to assign information-processing priority to threat-relevant information about feared stimuli in the environment (McNally, 1996). Although similar information processing biases have been reported across the anxiety disorders, this has not been a consistent finding in OCD (e.g., Foa, Amir, Gershuny, Molnar, Kozak, 1997). Studies suggest that the propensity to assign information-processing priority to threat-relevant content may be partially based on expectations that aversive consequences will follow exposure to threat-relevant stimuli (Taylor & Rachman, 1994a). For example, it has been well documented that anxious individuals tend to interpret ambiguous data as threatening (Rapee & Lim, 1992; Stopa & Clark, 1993). These findings highlight the possibility that anxious individuals may have more readily available access to threat-specific interpretations of anxiety-related events. In addition to the tendency to give greater information-processing priority to threat-relevant stimuli, there is also evidence suggesting that individuals with specific fears give less processing priority to safety resources. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2953684237, 'Strategically-motivated advanced persistent threat: Definition, process, tactics and a disinformation model of counterattack', 'Atif Ahmad (University of Melbourne), Jeb Webb (Oceania Cyber Security Centre, Melbourne, Australia), Kevin C.

When combined with moist wipe sampling, the cry1 qPCR was a rapid, reliable, and sensitive diagnostic tool for detecting and quantifying Bt contamination, and mapping endospore dispersal within a mail sorting facility. Results from the cry1 qPCR were validated by viable counts of the same samples on Bacillus -selective agar (PEMBA), which revealed a similar pattern of contamination. Extensive and persistent contamination of the facility was detected, both within the affected mailroom, and extending into office areas up to 30\xa0m distant from the source event, emphasising the need for improved containment procedures for suspicious mail items, both during and post-event.

In this paper, a theory-driven model is proposed for fake news detection. The method investigates news content at various levels: lexicon-level, syntax-level, semantic-level and discourse-level.

Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD) show cognitive deficits that are similar to but milder than those seen in SZ. Whether this similarity extends to the functioning of the semantic system is unclear. To test the hypothesis that it does, we adapted a clustering technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) to investigate the clustering pattern of semantic retrieval in BD. Two category-fluency tasks (animal and supermarket-item naming) were administered to 98 adult outpatients with BD and 98 healthy adults (NC) who matched the BD group in age, sex, education, and estimated premorbid IQ. Results of clustering analysis showed that patients with BD produced less coherent category clusters than healthy adults. Specifically, patients with BD showed less coherent clusters of low-frequency animal names, but their overall productivity was not more impaired than the NCs'. In the supermarket condition, patients not only showed incoherent clustering of named supermarket items regardless of their frequencies, but also produced smaller numbers of exemplars than NCs did. The semantic system abnormalities shown by adults with BD were similar to those we found previously in persons with SZ, although the group differences were smaller.

We combine the two hidden vectors resulted from the above extractions into an attention matrix and learn an attention distribution over the vectors.

Rather, different researchers are interested in answering different questions about the relationship(s) between genes, behaviors, and development, and they use different methodologies to answer their questions. The same diversity holds for human behavioral genetics: different researchers are interested in different questions, and in attempting to answer those questions they use different approaches. At the broadest level, one can distinguish between (1) research into the differences in behaviors between different individuals and (2) research into behaviors shared by (most) individuals. It is obvious that some traits vary between people. Different people tend to act differently--when, for example, someone is said to be shy, it follows that, in general, they act differently at parties than people who are said to be gregarious. It is equally obvious that some traits do not vary much between people--although different people may speak different languages, all normal human adults (unlike other animals) use some complex language and learn that language while growing up. Researchers interested in the differences within a population will focus on the variation within that population. For example, within normal human populations, some people are taller than others, some people score higher on standardized intelligence tests than others, and some are more prone to violent behavior than others. Researchers interested in such differences attempt to discover how these differences are associated with the presence or absence of particular genes or environments. In other words, are particular genes associated with being more (rather than less) prone to violence? Do particular environments in which children grow up result in their being more (rather than less) likely to score highly on intelligence quotient (IQ) tests? More generally, such research focuses on particular differences in the resources used in organismal development. Humans, for example, develop over time from a single fertilized egg to an adult capable of a variety of complex behaviors, behaviors that require a body consisting of an astonishingly complex organization of many different types of cells. The development of any complex organism requires a variety of resources. Some of these resources are genetic (the genetic material inherited from the parents), some are environmental (from the prenatal environment of the mother, to the provision of food, and so forth), and some are hard to classify (the complex subcellular systems that, in conjunction with genes, make proteins, etc.). The outcome of this development is a complex organism that differs from (and, of course, resembles) other organisms in the population in a variety of ways. The goal of research focused on differences is to find ways to associate different phenotypes with differences in how the organisms developed--whether different phenotypes had, for example, different genes or experienced different environments. (1) In these projects, the hope is that researchers will be able to explain how differences in available resources produce different outcomes. More specifically, human behavioral genetics research that is focused on variation in human behavioral tendencies tries to associate different behavioral tendencies with genetic differences. It asks, for instance, if people who are more prone to violent behavior are also more likely to have certain genes, or if people who tend to score highly on standardized intelligence tests also share particular genetic traits. On the other hand, researchers interested in behaviors that do not vary significantly within a population have other goals. In the study of behaviors shared by (most) humans, the purpose is to figure out how particular traits are produced in normal development. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2788768240, 'Perceived Social Presence Reduces Fact-Checking', 'Youjung Jun (Columbia University), Rachel Meng (Columbia University), Gita Johar (Columbia University)', 2017, 7, 'Today’s media landscape affords people access to richer information than ever before, with many individuals opting to consume content through social channels rather than traditional news sources.

We are fast reaching the point where expertly controlled computers can adjust an image, pixel by microscopic pixel, and not leave a clue behind.” (David Brin, The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom? 28 (1998)). Now, many articles are reporting that a similar technological transformation is occurring in the realm of audio- and video recording. Legislators and legal scholars have begun asking what laws or technological measures can be used to protect the public from being deceived by “deep fake” videos. \r\n\r\nThis symposium essay considers how First Amendment free speech protection might apply to the creation of such videos – and how such protection might differ from the protection that the Supreme Court found, in 2012, applies to false statements of fact. First, it analyzes how courts have generally adhered to a well-established dichotomy in First Amendment treatment of false claims: In the commercial marketplace, government often stands ready to intervene to protect us against being sold forgeries or other fake goods. The same is true in certain situations where security is at stake, for example, where a fake ID might give a person unwarranted access to an airplane or a building off-limits to the general public. Matters are very different, by contrast in the marketplace of ideas. Here, individuals are largely on their own. Government may not constitutionally exile certain ideas from the free trade in ideas, as it can ban harmful goods or services from the realm of buying and selling. In the realm of free expression, wrote Justice Jackson, “every person must be his own watchman for truth, because the forefathers did not trust any government to separate the true from the false for us.” Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945) (Jackson, J concurring). The justices in the 2012 case, United States v. Alvarez, disagreed about how to classify verifiably false autobiographical statement in this dichotomy (and thus disagreed about how to analyze Alvarez’s false claim to have won a Congressional medal of honor). But they largely agreed that false statements on matters of public concern should generally be treated as contributions to the marketplace of ideas, and receive staunch First Amendment protection – unless they constitute defamation, fraud, or some other legally-cognizable harm. \r\n\r\nHaving examined the Alvarez decision and certain difficulties that confront it, the essay then asks whether this First Amendment framework requires modification when the vehicle for deception is not merely a falsity but a forgery – that is, where it is not merely the content of the speech that is intended to deceive, but also its purported source or vehicle. A deep fake video, for example, does not simply present a false description of an event. It clothes such falsity in the authority of video evidence. The essay considers some of the reasons why the First Amendment should perhaps give government greater leeway to regulate fake video- or audio-recording than verbal lies - why, for example, a false statement about war-time actions might be protected speech, whereas a fake video of an event in that war allowing people to see with their own eyes, events which never occurred - might raise more significant concerns. Or why the false content in a fake news article may be protected speech but this may not be true of the false guise it wears as a New York Times, Chicago Tribune, or Washington Post article when neither publication played any role in it. The essay also briefly considers some of the difficulties that courts would face in attempting to differentiate in this way between falsity and forgery, and providing different First Amendment rules to each category of deception.', 0.0, 1, 0.0, 2.15527793815886e-05), (2619099836, 'Multisensory Integration of Low-Level Information in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Measuring Susceptibility to the Flash-Beep Illusion.', 'Vanessa A.

These findings suggest that emotion-related disturbances are not explained by early automatic processing stages, and that activity in the dorsal visual stream underlying implicit emotion processing is intact in bipolar disorder.

Agents can either endorse or oppose a claim made in a piece of news, which itself may be either true or false. Agents base their decision on a private signal and their neighbors' past actions. Given these inputs, agents follow strategies derived via multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and receive utility from acting in accordance with the veracity of claims. Our framework yields strategies with agent utility close to a theoretical, Bayes optimal benchmark, while remaining flexible to model re-specification. Optimized strategies allow agents to correctly identify most false claims, when all agents receive unbiased private signals. However, an adversary's attempt to spread fake news by targeting a subset of agents with a biased private signal can be successful. Even more so when the adversary has information about agents' network position or private signal. When agents are aware of the presence of an adversary they re-optimize their strategies in the training stage and the adversary's attack is less effective.

Among these was one centering on HIV's origin. A startling hypothesis, called here the “HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth,” asserted that HIV had been a product, accidental or intentional, of bioweaponry research. While its earliest identifiable contributors were in the West, this myth's most dynamic propagators were in the East. The Soviet security service, the KGB, took “active measures” to create and disseminate AIDS disinformation beginning no later than July 1983 and ending no earlier than October 1987. The East German security service, a complex bureaucracy popularly known as “the Stasi,” was involved, too, but how early, how deeply, how uniformly, how ably, and how successfully has not been clear. Following German reunification, claims arose attributing to the Stasi the masterful execution of ingenious elements in a disinformation campaign they helped shape and soon came to dominate. We have tested these claims. Question Was the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth a Stasi success? Methods Primary sources were documents and photographs assembled by the Ministry of State Security (MfS) of the German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany), the Ministry of Interior of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the United States Department of State; the estate of myth principals Jakob and Lilli Segal; the “AIDS box” in the estate of East German literary figure Stefan Heym; participant-observer recollections, interviews, and correspondence; and expert interviews. We examined secondary sources in light of primary sources. Findings The HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth had debuted in print in India in 1983 and had been described in publications worldwide prior to 1986, the earliest year for which we found any Stasi document mentioning the myth in any context. Many of the myth's exponents were seemingly independent conspiracy theorists. Its single most creative exponent was Jakob Segal, an idiosyncratic Soviet biologist long resident in, and long retired in, the GDR. Segal applied to the myth a thin but tenacious layer of plausibility. We could not exclude a direct KGB influence on him but found no evidence demonstrating it. The Stasi did not direct his efforts and had difficulty tracking his activities. The Stasi were prone to interpretive error and self-aggrandizement. They credited themselves with successes they did not achieve, and, in one instance, failed to appreciate that a major presumptive success had actually been a fiasco. Senior Stasi officers came to see the myth's propagation as an embarrassment threatening broader interests, especially the GDR's interest in being accepted as a scientifically sophisticated state. In 1986, 1988, and 1989, officers of HV A/X, the Stasi's disinformation and “active measures” department, discussed the myth in meetings with the Bulgarian secret service. In the last of these meetings, HV A/X officers tried to interest their Bulgarian counterparts in taking up, or taking over, the myth's propagation. Further efforts, if any, were obscured by collapse of the East German and Bulgarian governments. Conclusion No, the HIV-from-Fort-Detrick myth was not a Stasi success. Impressions to the contrary can be attributed to reliance on presumptions, boasts, and inventions. Presumptions conceding to the Stasi an extraordinary operational efficiency and an irresistible competence - qualities we could not confirm in this case - made the boasts and inventions more convincing than their evidentiary basis, had it been known, would have allowed. The result was disinformation about disinformation, a product we call “disinformation squared.”", 199.0, 3, 0.00201207243460765, 4.02490874188964e-05), (1971651582, 'Information, disinformation, and union success in certification and decertification elections', 'Victor G.

Yet, it was, if not a turning point in the war, a perfect example of the challenges fighting in Iraq - and very possibly any future conflicts against Islamist insurgencies - has presented that are new and almost impossible to answer effectively. Valhalla was an engagement between a battalion of U.S. Special Forces Soldiers with the Iraqi Special Forces unit it was training on one side, and a Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM) death squad (better known as Mahdi Army) on the other. The engagement was entirely ordinary: the U.S. forces tracked down the JAM fighters responsible for the especially brutal murders of a number of civilians and several Iraqi troops. When U.S. and Iraqi government forces reached the JAM compound, a brief firelight ensued. However, as the JAM forces engaged well-trained, well-armed Soldiers instead of unarmed civilians, their fortunes took an abrupt turn. It was what happened after the firefight was over - in fact, after U.S. and Iraqi government forces left the area - that made this particular engagement so worth studying in detail. Neither the battalion of the U.S. Army\'s 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) under the command of then Lieutenant Colonel Sean Swindell (at the time a part of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force, Arabian Peninsula [CJSOTF-AP]) nor the Iraqi government forces took any casualties during the fighting on 26 March 2006, beyond one Iraqi Soldier with a non-life-threatening injury. Sixteen or 17 JAM were killed, a weapons cache found and destroyed, a badly beaten hostage found and rescued, and approximately 16 other JAM members detained, at which point U.S. and Iraqi government forces left the site. Based on his encounters with AI-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and other Sunni insurgent groups, Colonel Kenneth Tovo, the commanding officer of both the 1 Oth Group and the CJSOTF-AP at the time, reports that a 24- to 48-hour cycle between an event and the appearance on the Internet of propaganda regarding that event had become routine to Special Forces operating in Iraq during that period. However, on 26 March 2006, by the time the SF and Iraqi forces returned to their compound, roughly an hour after leaving the site of the firefight, someone had moved the bodies and removed the guns of the JAM fighters back at their compound so that it no longer looked as if they had fallen while firing weapons. They now looked as if they had fallen while at prayer. Someone had photographed the bodies in these new poses and the images had been uploaded to the web, along with a press release explaining that American Soldiers had entered a mosque and killed men peacefully at prayer. All this had taken approximately 45 minutes. As Colonel Tovo said, "Literally they had their story, their propaganda, out on the wires before the assault force was back at the compound, so [in] under an hour, they had their counter-story already on the wires. That\'s how brilliant [this was. It] really surprised us that first time, because we were kind of used to the AI-Qaeda and Sunni insurgent model, which was 24 to 48 hours. . .to get their story out...."1 Needless to say, both the American and Arab media picked up the story almost immediately. Also, needless to say, the result was an investigation that took roughly a month, during which the unit was, to put it bluntly, benched. Thus, a unit that could never have been bested in actual combat by JAM forces was essentially neutralized for a month by those same forces using a cell phone camera. Fortunately, U.S. forces had been accompanied by members of the "combat camera" units, and had themselves been wearing "helmet cams" in several cases. Thus "before" pictures were available to contrast with the "after" pictures the militia members posted to the web.

Loewy (University of California, Davis)', 2007, 7, ": The ritual of taking an oath upon graduating from medical school is, with a few exceptions, a routine requirement for graduation. Albeit that many students believe that they have taken the Hippocratic Oath, this is virtually never the case. Very often students themselves write many of these oaths, and taking such an oath impresses the student as well as the public, who are potential patients. It sketches the ethically proper way for physicians to treat their patients. Such an oath is meaningful only when it is not coerced but in reality sketches the physicians' obligations toward patients, society, and each other. The question and problem of a coerced oath are discussed. It is concluded that students when first entering medical school know that such an oath will be a requirement for graduation, and because much of the time the persons taking the oath are writing it, I believe that coercion is not a factor. It is an unfortunate fact that throughout the nation students who are known to behave in ethically inappropriate ways are nevertheless allowed to graduate. Possible ways of addressing this troubling situation are discussed. Equally troublesome is the fact that we who administer the oath as well as the students who swear to it are aware that the system of medical care makes it extremely difficult and at times impossible to truly adhere to the full implications of this oath. According to the oath, physicians (in virtually all formulations) swear that social standing (and by implication economic factors) will not change the way in which patients are treated. This becomes impossible when uninsured patients are sent away at the front desk long before the physician can interact with them. Furthermore, the current fact that physicians often are confronted with not doing what they consider a necessary test (or prescribe what they think would be the best medication) raises the problem of either lying or suggesting to the patient that he/she do so--a fact that in the long run cannot help but damage the physician's veracity and the trust which patients put in their physicians.

In Experiment 1, we examined the use of recollection rejection to reject contradictory and additive misinformation. We measured recollection rejection by comparing misinformation acceptance rates, graphing confidence-accuracy data using phantom receiver operating characteristic curves, examining high confidence rejections of misinformation, and examining self-report responses. These measures converged on the finding that participants used recollection rejection to reject both types of misinformation but used recollection rejection more on contradictory misinformation. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the delay between the event and misinformation and between misinformation and test. The length of both of these delays affected misinformation acceptance. Participants were more likely to use recollection rejection to reject contradictory misinformation after a short delay before encountering misinformation. Overall these findings indicate that people can spontaneously induce recollection rejection to reject misinformation and prevent false memories.

Powerful images of the Internet enabling access to a global treasure trove of information have shifted to worries over the degree to which those who use social media, and online tools such as search engines, are being fed inaccurate, fake, or politically-targeted information that could distort public opinion and political change. There are serious questions raised over the political implication of any biases embedded in the algorithms that drive search engines and social media. Do digital media biases shape access to information shaping public opinion? To address these issues, we conducted an online survey of stratified random samples in seven nations, including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the US. We asked Internet users how they use search, social media, and other media, for political information, and what difference it makes for them. The findings cast doubt on technologically deterministic perspectives on search, such as filter bubbles. For example, our findings show that search is among an array of media consulted by those interested in politics. Internet users are not trapped in a bubble on a single platform. Another deterministic narrative is around the concept of echo chambers, where social media enable users to cocoon themselves with likeminded people and viewpoints. However, most of those interested in politics search for and double check problematic political information, and expose themselves to a variety of viewpoints. Thus, prevailing views on search and politics not only over-estimate technical determinants, but also underestimate the social shaping of the Internet, social media, and search. National media cultures and systems play an important role in shaping search practices, along with individual differences in political and Internet orientations.

This article presents a novel approach to tackle this stance detection problem, based on the combination of string similarity features with a deep neural network architecture that leverages ideas previously advanced in the context of learning-efficient text representations, document classification, and natural language inference. Specifically, we use bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), together with max-pooling over the temporal/sequential dimension and neural attention, for representing (i) the headline, (ii) the first two sentences of the news article, and (iii) the entire news article. These representations are then combined/compared, complemented with similarity features inspired on other FNC-1 approaches, and passed to a final layer that predicts the stance of the article toward the headline. We also explore the use of external sources of information, specifically large datasets of sentence pairs originally proposed for training and evaluating natural language inference methods to pre-train specific components of the neural network architecture (e.g., the RNNs used for encoding sentences).

Those who constructed a composite viewed their own composite during the 1-week delay, while those who did not construct a composite were yoked with someone who did, thereby viewing their counterpart's composite. In session 2, all participants completed a six-person forced-choice identification task. The participant was asked to identify the target from a six-person photo array.

The Motivated System 2 Reasoning (MS2R) account posits that deliberation causes people to fall for fake news, because reasoning facilitates identity-protective cognition and is therefore used to rationalize content that is consistent with one\'s political ideology. The classical account of reasoning instead posits that people ineffectively discern between true and false news headlines when they fail to deliberate (and instead rely on intuition). To distinguish between these competing accounts, we investigated the causal effect of reasoning on media truth discernment using a 2-response paradigm. Participants (N = 1,635 Mechanical Turkers) were presented with a series of headlines. For each, they were first asked to give an initial, intuitive response under time pressure and concurrent working memory load. They were then given an opportunity to rethink their response with no constraints, thereby permitting more deliberation. We also compared these responses to a (deliberative) 1-response baseline condition where participants made a single choice with no constraints. Consistent with the classical account, we found that deliberation corrected intuitive mistakes: Participants believed false headlines (but not true headlines) more in initial responses than in either final responses or the unconstrained 1-response baseline. In contrast-and inconsistent with the Motivated System 2 Reasoning account-we found that political polarization was equivalent across responses. Our data suggest that, in the context of fake news, deliberation facilitates accurate belief formation and not partisan bias.

To test the power of this approach, we use genotype data from a major depressive disorder (MDD) case/control sample (total N=1,537). DeepWAS identified 177 regulatory SNPs moderating 122 functional units. MDD regulatory SNPs were located mostly in promoters, intronic and distal intergenic regions and validated with public data. Blood regulatory SNPs were experimentally annotated with methylation quantitative trait loci (QTLs), expression quantitative trait methylation loci and expression QTLs and replicated in an independent cohort. Joint integrative analysis of regulatory SNPs and the independently identified annotations were connected through transcription factors MEF2A, MEF2C and ATF2, regulating a network of transcripts previously linked to other psychiatric disorders.

Yet, in every jurisdiction that has considered the issue, that very same lawyer will run afoul of her duties if she affirmatively misrepresents a collateral consequence—every jurisdiction, that is, except Kentucky. The Supreme Court of Kentucky recently held that when there is no duty to warn about a consequence because it is collateral, misadvice about that same consequence is not a constitutional violation. The collision of the collateral-consequences rule, which imposes no duty to warn, and the affirmative-misadvice exception, which imposes a duty to give accurate advice where a lawyer chooses to warn, leads to a perverse incentive structure that signals to defense lawyers (as well as to prosecutors and judges) that it is safest to say nothing at all about “collateral” matters. The Kentucky approach that the Supreme Court will review is equally troubling; it allows false information with no sanction or remedy.

These consequences touch upon every important area of a convicted person’s life—for the rest of his or her life. They also matter enormously in the United States, which has more than 600,000 individuals exiting the prison system and millions more getting criminal records each year. These individuals enter a society that is struggling to find ways to integrate them despite facing considerable obstacles. The constitutional rule has not caught up to the current reality of the effect of these consequences on defendants, their families, and their communities. The Supreme Court has the opportunity to overcome the mythical divide between direct and collateral consequences and to protect the constitutional and ethical values which underlie a defendant’s right to decide whether to plead guilty based on full knowledge of the material consequences. The Court will consider important issues of professional responsibility, ethics, transparency, and the right to information in the guilty-plea process.

The present study examined whether those individuals with high levels of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms show a memory bias recall to perceptual cues and trauma target words compared to those with low levels of PTSD. Methods The sample consisted of 30 adult participants who were involved in motor-vehicle or work-related accidents; 15 of the participants endorsed clinically elevated symptoms of PTSD, while a comparison group of 15 participants reported low levels of symptoms. Participants performed an associative recognition task with conceptual or perceptual cue words and trauma-related or neutral target words. Participants were tested for their recognition accuracy by reporting the corresponding target when a cue was given. Results Both groups performed better for the perceptual word pairs than for the conceptual word pairs, irrespective of the target word type. However, only the high PTSD symptoms group exhibited an additional enhancement in performance for the perceptual word pairs with trauma-related target words. Limitations A nonclinical sample was utilized for this study; although PTSD was assessed, diagnoses were not confirmed. In addition, there was lack of a healthy non-traumatized control group.

It is urgent to achieve misinformation identification and early detection in social media. However, two main difficulties hinder the identification of misinformation. First, an event about a piece of suspicious news usually comprises massive microblog posts (hereinafter referred to as post), and it is hard to directly model the event with massive-volume posts. Second, information in social media is of high noise, i.e., most posts about an event have little contribution to misinformation identification. To resolve the difficulty of massive volume, we propose an Event2vec module to learn distributed representations of events in social media. To overcome the difficulty of high noise, we mine significant posts via content and temporal co-attention, which learn importance weights for content and temporal information of events. In this paper, we propose an Attention-based Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (ACAMI) model. The Event2vec module and the co-attention contribute to learning a good representation of an event. Then the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection. Experimental results on two typical datasets validate the effectiveness of the ACAMI model on misinformation identification and early detection tasks.', 886.0017399267401, 2, 0.0186440677966102, 2.2300386102103e-05), (176107497, 'CONTAINMENT OF MISINFORMATION PROPAGATION IN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS WITH GIVEN DEADLINE', 'Nan Wang , Li Yu , Ni Ding , Dong Yang ', 2014, 6, 'In recent years, online social networks have become one of the most influential mediums of sharing information.

To this end, the current studies used a different set of materials and a different measure of memory impairment, the Modified Recognition Test (McCloskey & Zaragoza, 1985). In Experiment 1a, we established that our reactivation manipulation was effective by showing that we could replicate the well-established retrieval enhanced suggestibility effect with our materials. However, when we assessed potential impairment of the witnessed memory with the Modified Recognition Test (Experiments 1a and 1b), we failed to find evidence that reactivating the witnessed memory prior to misinformation impaired memory for the originally witnessed event. In Experiment 2, we replicated Chan and LaPaglia’s (2013) findings when we used their memory impairment measure (misinformation-free True/False Recognition Test) and showed why that test does not permit clear inferences about memory impairment.

Although parents and patients have a number of concerns about vaccine safety, among the most common are fears that adjuvants like aluminum, preservatives like mercury, inactivating agents like formaldehyde, manufacturing residuals like human or animal DNA fragments, and simply the sheer number of vaccines might be overwhelming, weakening or perturbing the immune system.

Admittedly it is a peculiar book by a writer whose other works (some interesting if precious early short fiction and the impenetrable verse drama, Antiphon) are less than inviting. Nightwood itself is most often remembered for its high reputation with writers like T. S. Eliot. Apart from this sort of recognition it is examined either as a cache of modernism or, because it is rather tangled and obscure, it is sometimes rewarded with an extravagant explication de texte.\' In short, it has not been much appreciated by critics while among novelists, notably Hawkes and Pynchon, it resonates. Hawkes picks up on the blighted landscape and the fictive detachment which allows Barnes to make comedy of violence, and Pynchon parodies her style in V while attending closely to her view of history as a bowdlerized version of human damnation. These correspondences are not so much influences as affinities, and the most salient of them is the writer\'s suspicion of the morality of writing itself. It is this suspicion which causes Hawkes to observe that Djuna Barnes assumed a "prophetic role in reverse," by which he probably meant that she used the experimental techniques of her novel to break down the conventions of characterization and relationships in order to get back to "the tangled seepage of our earliest recollections and originations."2 Throughout Nightwood the theme of de-evolution or of bowing down ("Bow Down" is the title of the first section and was originally meant to be the title for the whole book) has implications for the act of writing.

Method: About 2 months before deployment to Afghanistan, 249 soldiers enrolled in this study, which was embedded in a larger project. Two months after deployment, participants were interviewed about stressors on deployment and they received subtle misinformation about a fictional event on deployment. Seven months later, they were retested, and completed a questionnaire about events on deployment. Results: At 9 months, a total of 26% of participants reported that they had experienced the fictional event, although 7 months earlier they said they had not experienced it. Logistic regression analyses revealed that lower cognitive ability and a combination of high arousal and more stressors on deployment were related to higher susceptibility to the misinformation effect. Conclusions: Results suggest that information provided by another source may be incorporated into related autobiographical memory, particularly for individuals with lower cognitive ability, high arousal at the time of encoding the information and more related experiences.

While the vast majority of models are ineffective, we were able to produce a number of models that yield highly accurate decisions, thus effectively separating fake news from actual stories. Specifically, we focused our analysis on models that rank a randomly chosen fake news story higher than a randomly chosen fact with more than 0.85 probability. For these models we found a strong link between features and model predictions, showing that some features are clearly tailored for detecting certain types of fake news, thus evidencing that different combinations of features cover a specific region of the fake news space.

This aspect of information seeking is important, especially for people affected by chronic pathologies and require lifelong treatment and management. These people are usually very well informed about the disease but are nonetheless vulnerable to hopes of being cured or saved, often amplified by misinformation, myths, legends, and therapies that are not always scientifically proven. Many studies suggest that some individuals prefer to rely on the Internet as their main source of information, often hindering the patient-doctor relationship. A professional approach is imperative to maintain confidentiality, honesty, and trust in the medical profession. Objective we aimed to examine, in a medically supervised Italian web community (SMsocialnetwotk.com) dedicated to people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), the posts shared by users and to verify the reliability of contents of posts shared by users pinpointed as Influencers through an online questionnaire. Methods we grouped the posts published on SMsocialnetwork from April to June 2015 into those with medical content (scientifically correct or fake news), and those related to social interactions. Later, we gave a questionnaire to the community asking to identify the three users/Influencers providing the most reliable advice for everyday life with MS and the three users/Influencers providing the most useful information about MS treatments. Results 308 posts reported scientific and relevant medical information, whereas 72 posts included pieces of fake news. 1420 posts were of general interest. Four out of the 6 Influencers had written only posts with correct medical information (3 were pwMS, 1 was a Neurologist) and never any fake news. The remaining 2 appointed Influencers (2 pwMS) had written only posts about general interests. Conclusion the identification of fake news and their authors has shown that the latter are never appointed as Influencers. SMsocialnetwork.com acted as a “web safe environment” where the Influencers contributed by sharing only correct medical information and never fake news. We speculate that the presence of neurologists and psychologists supervising the information flow might have contributed to reduce the risk of fake news spreading and to avoid their acquisition of authoritative meaning.', 685.333333333333, 1, 0.0, 2.1522908864530302e-05), (2042447454, 'What a Hoax', 'Sander van der Linden ', 2013, 5, 'Conspiracy theories offer easy answers by casting the world as simpler and more predictable than it is.

First Amendment Theory Meets Fake News and the Filter Bubble', 'Philip M. Napoli (Duke University)', 2017, 5, 'A central tenet of First Amendment theory is that more speech is an effective remedy against false speech. This counterspeech doctrine was first explicitly articulated by Justice Louis Brandeis in Whitney v. California (1927), in which he wrote, “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” Since then, the effectiveness of counterspeech has become an integral to most conceptualizations of a functioning marketplace of ideas, in which direct government regulation of speech is minimized in favor of an open and competitive speech environment in which ideas are free to circulate, and in which truthful speech is presumed to be inherently capable of winning out over false speech. \r\nThis paper seeks to unpack the assumptions about the dynamics of the production, dissemination, and consumption of news that are embedded in the counterspeech doctrine. This paper then questions whether these assumptions remain viable in the face of the realities of the contemporary media ecosystem; and if not, what this means for contemporary media policy. \r\nIn addressing this issue, this paper will first review the counterspeech doctrine; the ways it has been put into practice in legal and policy decision-making; and the critiques that have been leveled against. This section will illustrate that critiques thus far have focused questioning whether counterspeech provides adequate protections against types of speech such as pornography and hate speech. Missing, at this point, has been a broader inquiry into whether the media ecosystem has evolved in ways that undermine the validity of the counterspeech doctrine. \r\nThis paper will then detail the technological changes that have affected the media ecosystem and media users over the past two decades that bear directly on the continued validity of the counterspeech doctrine. Specifically, technological changes have: \r\na) affected the relative prominence of the production of true versus false news; \r\nb) diminished the gatekeeping barriers that have traditionally curtailed the dissemination of false news; \r\nc) increased the ability of those producing false news to target those most likely to be affected by false news; \r\nd) enhanced the speed at which false news travels; \r\ne) diminished the likelihood of being exposed to accurate news that counteracts false news. \r\nThus, just as it has been argued that the assumptions underlying the Second Amendment right to bear arms (written in the era of muskets and flintlocks) may not be transferrable to today’s technological environment of automatic assault weapons, it may be time to reconsider whether fundamental aspects of First Amendment theory are effectively transferrable to today’s radically different media environment. \r\nFinally, in considering the media law and policy implications of this argument, this paper will consider the implications of the seldom discussed qualification in Brandeis’ statement (“if there be time…”), its possible relevance to contemporary media policymaking, and whether other qualifications are now in order.', 0.0, 1, 0.0, 2.2292056774624697e-05), (2757311548, 'Automatic Detection of Fake News on Social Media Platforms.', 'Christian Janze (Goethe University Frankfurt), Marten Risius (Clemson University)', 2017, 5, 'This study investigates how fake news shared on social media platforms can be automatically identified.

ADHD children with overlapping symptoms and signs of motor problems have more serious prognosis than that of children with ADHD only. However, the motor and sensory processing problems in children with ADHD have not been studied well. Few people adopt the technique of computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) in the study of ADHD, which is applied widely in clinical and laboratory research to objectively evaluate human's balance performance. This study aimed to assess the characteristics of postural control and sensory information processing of boys with two subtypes of ADHD by using CDP, so as to provide the proof for non-drug therapy of ADHD. METHOD: From June 2003 to September 2004, a total of 73 boys (7-15 years of age) with ADHD and 73 normal developing boys matched by age and intelligence quotient from Peking University Institute of Mental Health were recruited in the study. The Sensory Organization Test was adopted to test the static balance performance under six sensory input conditions by SMART EquiTest 8.0 (NeuroCom) instrument. The sensory information from three sensory systems were available under condition 1, the visual inputs were removed or distorted under condition 2 or 3, the somatosensory inputs were in conflict with or without the visual inputs removed under condition 4 or 5, and both the visual and somatosensory inputs were in conflict under condition 6. The indexes of equilibrium score, somatosensory, vestibular, and visual ratios, and strategy scores were analyzed to indicate the subjects' postural control ability. RESULTS: ADHD boys had significantly lower composite equilibrium score (CES) than the normal group (P 0.05). Compared with the control group, the ADHD-I boys showed significantly lower visual and vestibular ratios and strategy scores under conditions 4-6 whereas the ADHD-C boys showed a trend of lower visual ratio (all P CONCLUSIONS: ADHD boys had a poorer static postural control ability and impaired function of processing visual and vestibular information compared with the normal control. Boys with ADHD-I showed particularly severe defect of static postural control and vestibular function integrating conflict information than normal boys. These deficits may be an important contributor to the clinical presentation of ADHD children and their cognitive deficits.

After reading a fictional story, participants answered questions containing misleading details that were either additive (misleading details that supplemented an original event) or contradictory (errors that changed original details). On a final test, suggestibility was greater for additive than contradictory misinformation, and older adults endorsed fewer false contradictory details than younger adults. To mitigate suggestibility in Experiment 2, participants were warned about potential errors, instructed to detect errors, or instructed to detect errors after exposure to examples of additive and contradictory details. Again, suggestibility to additive misinformation was greater than contradictory, and older adults endorsed less contradictory misinformation. Only after detection instructions with misinformation examples were younger adults able to reduce contradictory misinformation effects and reduced these effects to the level of older adults. Additive misinformation however, was immune to all warning and detection instructions. Thus, older adults were less susceptible to contradictory misinformation errors, and younger adults could match this misinformation rate when warning/detection instructions were strong.

Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, i.e., misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news. Based on the DLT model, we formulate an optimization problem that under cost constraints aims in identifying the most appropriate subset of users to limit the spread of misinformation by initiating the propagation of credible information.

In addition, Ca2+-CaM samples many conformational substates in the crystal and accurately modeling the full range of this functionally important disorder is challenging. In order to characterize these features in a minimally biased manner, a 1.0\u2005A resolution single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was measured for selenomethionine-substituted Ca2+-CaM. Density-modified electron-density maps enabled the accurate assignment of Ca2+-CaM main-chain and side-chain disorder. These experimental maps also substantiate complex disorder models that were automatically built using low-contour features of model-phased electron density. Furthermore, experimental electron-density maps reveal that 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) is present in the C-terminal domain, mediates a lattice contact between N-terminal domains and may occupy the N-terminal binding pocket. The majority of the crystal structures of target-free Ca2+-CaM have been derived from crystals grown using MPD as a precipitant, and thus MPD is likely to be bound in functionally critical regions of Ca2+-CaM in most of these structures.

In the second dataset, we collect tweets and URLs that co-occurred with "fake news" related keywords and hashtags, such as #FakeNews and #AlternativeFact, as well as reactions towards such tweets and URLs.

The cause of cell death during blood reperfusion and reactivation of heart muscle tissue after prolonged ischemia.', 'F S Sjöstrand (University of California, Los Angeles)', 1992, 5, ': An electron microscopic study of heart muscle tissue exposed to six hours ischemia and prepared according to the low denaturation embedding technique revealed a structural modification confined to the mitochondrial cristae. The modification consisted of a removal of Krebs cycle enzymes from the cristae. Reperfusion of the ischemic tissue after four hours ischemia led to extensive breakdown of the mitochondrial structure and contractility could not be restored. However, when after six hours ischemia the ischemic tissue was reperfused with blood, the composition of which had been modified to stimulate mitochondrial function, no additional structural changes were observed and contractility was restored. The structural damage caused by reperfusion with non modified blood is explained by a loss of control of plasma membrane permeability caused by impaired ATP production which makes the ionic composition of the cytosol approach that of blood plasma, stopping oxidative phosphorylation. A treatment to restore heart muscle function after long periods of ischemia and after heart transplantation is proposed. The structural damage revealed that the Krebs cycle and the respiratory chain enzymes are associated according to a regular periodic pattern and that the enzyme molecules are closely aggregated three-dimensionally. Earlier electron microscopic studies revealing massive structural deterioration of heart muscle cells already after 45 to 60 minutes ischemia leading to the conclusion that the cells are irreversibly damaged, is based on fixation artifacts caused by osmium fixation.

This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country.

It is tempting to believe that citation practices are worse in lower-impact journals, and that we can more easily rely on the quality of the logic and ideas presented in more prestigious journals. But we have noticed inaccurate citations in some high-impact journals as well. These observations led us to attempt to quantify the extent of inaccurate citation in the recently published ecological literature, to compare citation accuracy with journal impact factor (IF) and also compare our results to a previous study of citation accuracy in journals with IF[ 1 (Todd et al., 2007). Publication is one of the primary measures of success in the competitive field of academics. This, perhaps unavoidably, encourages the stretching of research to maximise the quantity of publications produced (Lawrence, 2003), can discourage transparency when it comes to sharing of information on methods (Anderson et al., 2007) and can seem to reward minor misconduct such as poor citation practices. The resulting unintentional or negligent spread of misinformation undermines scientific advancement and individual’s professional credibility over the long term.

Well-known accounts of less dominant top-down influences and more dominant bottom-up processes compete to explain these characteristics. These accounts have been recently embedded in the popular framework of predictive coding theory. To differentiate between competing accounts, we studied altered information dynamics in ASD by quantifying predictable information in neural signals. Predictable information in neural signals measures the amount of stored information that is used for the next time step of a neural process. Thus, predictable information limits the (prior) information which might be available for other brain areas, for example, to build predictions for upcoming sensory information. We studied predictable information in neural signals based on resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of 19 ASD patients and 19 neurotypical controls aged between 14 and 27 years. Using whole-brain beamformer source analysis, we found reduced predictable information in ASD patients across the whole brain, but in particular in posterior regions of the default mode network. In these regions, epoch-by-epoch predictable information was positively correlated with source power in the alpha and beta frequency range as well as autocorrelation decay time. Predictable information in precuneus and cerebellum was negatively associated with nonsocial symptom severity, indicating a relevance of the analysis of predictable information for clinical research in ASD.

Bracey ', 2006, 4, 'FOR MANY years now, Dennis Redovich and I have been screaming about what we might call the "high-skills hoax"--the notion that everyone must have high skills. Redovich runs the Center for the Study of Education and Jobs in Wisconsin and the U.S. It\'s not that we don\'t recognize a civil rights issue in the debate--everyone should have the opportunity to develop the skills to land a high-paying job. However, we understand the law of supply and demand, and we know about what jobs are actually being created. In fact, if everyone became highly skilled, the wages of skilled labor would fall, and the unemployment rates for skilled workers would rise, a condition conducive to social unrest. Most new jobs, though, continue to be in the low-paying service sector. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics issues its 10-year job creation forecasts, the number of new jobs for retail sales clerks alone approaches the number for the 10 fastest-growing jobs combined. At present, the number of people with bachelor\'s degrees is just about right to fill the proportion of jobs requiring them, and that proportion is not projected to increase much in the near future. Producing a great many more college grads will ... well, here we are again, back to supply and demand. Parallel to the claim that we will need more skilled workers is the claim that there is a mismatch between jobs and the skills of workers: workers don\'t have the skills that employers demand. We have argued against this, too. To date, our laments have gone for naught, but now we are joined by two well-known researchers at two well-known organizations: Paul Barton of ETS and Michael Handel of the Economic Policy Institute. Maybe now someone will take notice. Barton put together a summary monograph, High School Reform and Work: Facing Labor Market Realities, while Handel penned a small book, Worker Skills and Job Requirements: Is There a Mismatch? Indeed, there is a mismatch between young workers and what employers want: the workers are young, and employers don\'t want young people. Those who conducted one study using employer focus groups concluded, "We were surprised at just how much animosity there is toward young people in the employer community. In the focus groups the response was almost scatological." To ameliorate this situation, we must find a means to get around Hodgkinson\'s Law of Demographics, which I just named for demographer Harold Hodgkinson. Hodgkinson observes that 10 years from now everyone will be exactly 10 years older. We need to find a way to grow 26-year-olds in 18 years. (Twenty-six is about when young people with high school diplomas are old enough to be hired into jobs that might eventually pay a living wage--itself not a precise statistic.) Says Barton, "Employers, other than those in industries that rely heavily on teenagers, do not want to hire high school graduates until they are well into their 20s, irrespective of how well they do in high school" (emphasis in original). My guess is that the teen-laden businesses don\'t want to hire them either but have no choice. The skills deficit of young workers is often presented as a cohort effect: it is today\'s youths who are found particularly wanting. (The first Bracey Report in 1991 actually carried the title "Why Can\'t They Be Like We Were?" This was a lyric from the 1960 musical Bye Bye Birdie: "Why can\'t they be like we were, perfect in every way? Oh, what\'s the matter with kids today?") Handel and Barton see it instead as an age effect. Handel observes that employers have been complaining about young workers for decades but that the complaints don\'t follow the kids into adulthood. "As workers age and shoulder more adult responsibilities," Handel says, "they grow out of casual work attitudes and adjust to--or are socialized into [conditioned into? brainwashed into?]--the workplace norms of the jobs they consider worth keeping."

Methods: Data were collected from Microsoft’s Bing search engine and from the community question and answer site, Yahoo Answers. The questions were analyzed based on keywords and using further statistical methods. Results: Our results revealed that the Internet indeed constitutes a source of information for people searching the topic of ADHD, and that they search for information mostly about ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, individuals personally affected by the disorder made 2.0 more questions about ADHD compared with others. Questions begin when children reach 2 years of age, with an average age of 5.1 years. Most of the websites searched were not specifically related to ADHD and the timing of searches as well as the query content were different among those prediagnosis compared with postdiagnosis. Conclusions: The study results shed light on the features of ADHD-related searches.

Methods Participants included 34 individuals with hoarding disorder. Participants were randomized into a clutter or non-clutter condition and asked to complete various neuropsychological tasks of memory and attention. Results Results revealed that hoarding severity was associated with difficulties in sustained attention. However, individuals in the clutter condition relative to the non-clutter condition did not experience greater deficits in information processing.

Methods: Searches were run in eight electronic databases using a systematic search strategy. Qualitative and mixed-method studies published in English between 2007 and 2014 were included. Thematic synthesis was used to interpret and synthesis the results of the included studies. Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the synthesis.

The present study addressed this issue for children with ASD in school by administering a questionnaire to teachers of students with ASD who were and were not being given medication. Specifically, the questionnaire assessed the teachers’ knowledge about whether the child was being given medication, and whether behavior changes or side effects were being communicated in any way to the child’s family and prescribing physician. The results showed that for children who were being given medication, fewer than half of the teachers reported knowing the child was being given medication. For those children who were not being given medication, only 53 % of the teachers reported correct information for their students. Of the teachers who knew their students were being given medication, all reported that they were not conferring with the child’s prescribing physician regarding behavioral observations or side effects.

Primary care providers serve as the initial point of contact for the majority of patients with depression, yet, approximately 50% of cases remain unrecognized.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale and protocol of a clustered randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an HIT intervention that provides a multi-component approach to delivering culturally competent, mental health care in the primary care setting. The HIT intervention has four components: 1) web-based provider training, 2) multimedia electronic screening of depression and PTSD in the patients' primary language, 3) Computer generated risk assessment scores delivered directly to the provider, and 4) clinical decision support. The outcomes of the study include assessing the potential of the HIT intervention to improve screening rates, clinical detection, provider initiation of treatment, and patient outcomes for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among LEP Cambodian refugees who experienced war atrocities and trauma during the Khmer Rouge.

On the internet, a huge amount of information competes for our (limited) attention. Moreover, despite the increasing quantity of contents, quality may be poor, making the environment particularly florid for misinformation spreading. In such a context, our cognitive biases emerge, first and foremost, confirmation bias, i.e. the human tendency to look for information that is already in agreement with one's system of beliefs. To shade light on the phenomenon, we present a collection of works investigating how information gets consumed and shapes communities on Facebook. We find that confirmation bias plays a crucial role in content selection and diffusion, and we provide empirical evidence of the existence of echo chambers, i.e. well separated and polarised groups of like-minded users sharing a same narrative.

Online support was reassuring, empathetic, and available around the clock and less daunting than attending a face-to-face group. Many attributed their continued breastfeeding to the support they received.

Experiment 1 compared 2 levels of postwarning specificity: A general postwarning just stated the presence of misinformation, whereas a specific postwarning identified the test items for which misinformation had been presented earlier. The specific postwarning, but not the general postwarning, eliminated both the misinformation effect and its deleterious impact on memory monitoring (using a classic 2-alternative forced-choice recognition procedure). Experiment 2 ruled out an alternative interpretation of these findings and replicated this postwarning specificity pattern using a cued-recall test. We observed, in addition to the moderating influence of task representations on misinformation acceptance, 2 unexpected facilitative effects on event memory caused by misinformation. Misinformation facilitated event memory during narrative encoding if discrepancies between the event and the narrative were detected (Experiment 1) and during retrieval if a specific postwarning was combined with cued recall (Experiment 2).

Back then in 1910, she and her brother Adrian were sharing a house in Bloomsbury. The masterpiece novels, among them Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, To the Lighthouse, and The Waves, were all in her future. Not yet a novelist, Virginia Stephen became an activist for one day, who thumbed her nose at the British Navy in 1910. Hermione Lee reads the hoax as both a joke and a political act, in its "ridicule of empire, infiltration of the nation\'s defenses, mockery of bureaucratic procedures, cross-dressing and sexual ambiguity" (279). Kathy Phillips also sees Woolf questioning the authority of Empire in this hoax, suggesting that Woolf "identified with the colonists" (248). Jean Kennard represents it as "a power game in which the traditional emblems of superiority, masculinity, and whiteness were the counters" (151). In her representation, however, Woolf deliberately evades, presenting the actions as more of a lark--as more a fast-paced and hilarious adventure--than as actions against authority. Not originally involved in the hoax, she signed on "at the last moment" when two of the planners had withdrawn, because "Either they were ill; or they were afraid; or they had urgent business elsewhere." Horace Cole, the ringleader, burst through the door, distraught, to tell Adrian Stephen that they needed to find two more "conspirators." Virginia Stephen stepped up: "\'I\'m quote ready to come\' I said. \'I should like nothing better.\'" Woolf is trying to make her audience laugh, while presenting an inherently political act. Audience members remembered the 1940 talk anecdotally for its hilarity. But the memory is anecdotal, because only three pages could be found. Quentin Bell published them in an appendix to his 1972 biography of Woolf. The whereabouts of the rest of Woolf\'s speech were last known in 1955, more than a decade after Woolf\'s death. Then, memory was still firm enough that Dame Frances Farrer asked Leonard Woolf if she might see the talk. She represented the National Federation of Women\'s Institutes, and, since Woolf had given the talk at a Women\'s Institute meeting, Dame Frances thought it should have a place in their records. Leonard Woolf sent the Rodmell manuscript, but he also wrote Dame Frances that he had no other copy. He asked her to return the manuscript, "as there is no other, I think." The Agricultural Organisations Society had initially formed Women\'s Institutes in 1915. After World War I, they came under the auspices of the Board of Agriculture. By the time Woolf gave her lecture, the institutes were self-governing units, part of a rural movement of education. The Rodmell Institute asked Woolf to speak about books. She did not. Instead she talked about her part in the hoax, an autobiographical lecture unlike standard educational fare. The manuscript describes how friends darkened their skin, put on turbans and false beards, dressing up as an Emperor and his Princes from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). They sent a false telegram from the War Office to give credence to the imposture, requesting a tour of the Navy\'s flagship warship, the Dreadnought. Admiral May, in charge of the Dreadnought, fell for it, and the young people viewed the most recent war technology in the British Navy, particularly the wireless equipment. Woolf states that it was "of course the newest and the most efficient kind." The manuscript ended up in a box in the Women\'s Library of London Metropolitan University (5FWI/H/45 The Women\'s Library, London Metropolitan University). It is held in the Archive of the National Federation of Women\'s Institutes.

Copeland ', 2007, 4, 'In August 1835, the New York Sun published a series that came to define for media historians the sensational nature of penny-press news when Richard Adams Locke\'s story of the discovery of life on the moon captured national attention. What seems to contemporary readers as an obvious fabrication was accepted at the time as factual because the Moon Hoax was a series based in the contemporary wisdom of the age. Everyone believed intelligent life existed on other planets, and Locke used this wisdom along with some fortunate events-the return of Halley\'s Comet, astronomist John Herschel\'s trip to South Africa, and the demise of the Edinburgh Journal of Science-to create a series that initially fooled everyone. It built upon what had appeared in newspapers, almanacs, books, journals, and religious commentary for centuries. The story is well known, so well known, in fact, that one need only mention its moniker and nearly every media history student in the nation could describe its details. On August 21, 1835, a blurb on the second page of the New York Sun remarked that "some astronomical discoveries of the most wonderful description" had been uncovered by the English astronomer John Herschel. With that line by writer Richard Adams Locke, the most famous of newspaper hoaxes in American history was born. Before the Sun finished its series on August 31, it revealed that Herschel, with his massive telescope in South Africa, had uncovered "lunar vegetation . . . of great beauty" including a "lunar forest" and a "lunar plain" more than a one-half mile wide. He observed animals, too, one with "an amazingly long neck, head like a sheep, bearing two long spiral horns, white as polished ivory" and others that looked liked "a small kind of rein-deer, the elk, the moose, the horned bear, and the biped beaver." His ultimate discovery, though, was moon creatures who "were like human beings" and "averaged four feet in height, were covered, except on their face, with short and glossy copper-colored hair, and had wings composed of a thin membrane."1 The Suns revelations, reportedly taken from a supplement of the Edinburgh Journal of Science, would take on a life of their own in the following weeks and come to provide instructors of the history of the press with the perfect story to describe the penny press. It was, as Edgar Allan Poe would later write, "the greatest hit in the way of sensation-of merely popular sensation-ever made by any similar fiction either in America or in Europe."2 The Moon Hoax is recounted in every American media history textbook as well as whenever someone discusses tall tales, hoaxes, or sensationalism and the media,3 and it has been the subject of numerous journal articles.4 But why did so many believe the story? One writer noted "everyone believed it at first, and everyone bought the Sun to read about it." This led the New-York Daily Advertiser to remark, "No article has appeared for years that will command so general a perusal and publication," and it said Herschel had "added a stock of knowledge to the present age that will immortalize his name, and place it high on the page of science."5 Several scholars from Yale University even paid a visit to the Sun\'s office to obtain a copy of the fictitious Edinburgh Journal of Science article, "Great Astronomical Discoveries," since they could not find the supplement-which the Sun "reprinted"-in the college\'s library. Though they returned to New Haven empty handed after a day of futile searching, they still concluded in a college debate that Herschel\'s observations were, indeed, plausible.6 They were not the only scientists who were completely deceived by the Sun\'s astonishing stories.7 In addition, Philip Hone, New York City\'s former mayor, its wealthiest citizen, and a benefactor of the mercantile library, called the news in the Sun "enormously wonderful."8 Scholars have recounted the elements of the hoax,9 it ethics,10 its historiography," its sensational nature,12 its use as contemporary satire,13 and its implications for the Sun\'s circulation and news content. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (873647781, 'Integrated Business Planning: Is It a Hoax or Here to Stay?', 'Patrick Bower ', 2012, 4, 'EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Integrated Business Planning (IBP) is not new; it is just another name of a mature SO I was serious.

How could the director of Badlands (1973), one of the most moving and intelligent works of film in the early seventies, become in the late nineties the purveyor of the maudlin metaphysics that saturates to bursting The Thin Red Line (1998)? Of all the questions that arise from Malick\'s ambitious, problematic war film this is the one that troubles me the most. War not only brings out the worst in man, but also, it seems in this case (though not in Fuller\'s Fixed Bayonets [1951] or Peckinpah\'s Cross of Iron [1977]), the worst in an artist. How did it happen? How did a film so long in gestation, so serious in intent become the worthy successor of Lewis Milestone\'s All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) rather than, say, Godard\'s Les Carabiniers (1963)? I certainly won\'t propose a psychological or even socio-cultural explanation, but by comparing Malick\'s The Thin Red Line to Badlands and to Malick\'s source text James Jones\'s 1962 novel and by examining several of Malick\'s questionable aesthetic decisions, I hope to expose the film\'s inexcusable descent into the sentimental. One difference between the 1973 Malick and the 1998 one can be found in Badlands\'s singular instance of directorial self-inscription. During the interlude when Kit (Martin Sheen) and Holly (Sissy Spacek), on the run after a series of murders, are staying at a rich man\'s house, Kit answers the doorbell to find a man in a white hat and suit with what appears to be architectural or engineering plans rolled up under his arm. Our visitor is played by the director Terrence Malick who, before Kit turns him away, reaches in his pocket for a notebook and pen. "What\'s that?" Kit asks. "Well I\'d," Malick says, "I\'d like to leave a message, if that\'s o.k." "Sure," Kit says and takes the piece of paper. "You\'ll have to excuse me now. I have to go back inside. Bye." But after Sheen closes the door on his befuddled director, he drops the message into a large standing urn. The point seems clear enough: if the director as actor wants to leave a message, the director as artist is smart enough not to reveal it. In The Thin Red Line Malick upturns the urn and out comes, mostly by means of voiceover, more messages per square frame than a televised church service: "What\'s this war in the heart of nature?" "Who are you to live in all these many forms?" "You, too, are the source of all that\'s going to be born." "You give calm a spirit." "Maybe all men got one big soul." "This great evil, where did it come from?" "Does our ruin benefit the earth? Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed into this night?" "How did we lose the good that was given us?" "What keeps us from reaching out and touching the glory?" "Oh my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes, look out at the things you made. All things shining." 1 Surely this can\'t be the voiceover for a war film. Surely this must be the voiceover for a New Age promo. And most surely, there is, unlike in Badlands, with its constant contrasting of image and word, no irony anywhere in Malick\'s metaphysical gas.2 One can say, however, that The Thin Red Line is not a war film, but a meditation on the relationship of man to nature. But how does Malick present nature to us? Mostly in ponderous montage sequences-giant trees, entwined limbs, light on leaves-whose images shout: "Look at Me, look at Me. I am a Symbol of the Power and the Glory and the Mystery. Within Me is you and you are within Me. I am All That Ever Was and All That Ever Will Be. I am your Destiny. your Grace. I, too, am separated from Myself. I, too, am at war with Life and Death and the Ineffable Beyond. Ponder me and you will enter the Waters of Paradise and swim underwater with Native Boys."

This paper presents an improved formulation of the extant information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common deception types employed in “fake news” attacks. The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to “fake news” attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis.', 0.0, 0, 0.00027359781121751, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2898364746, 'Five Shades of Untruth: Finer-Grained Classification of Fake News', 'Liqiang Wang (Max Planck Society), Yafang Wang (Shandong University), Gerard de Melo (Rutgers University), Gerhard Weikum (Max Planck Society)', 2018, 4, 'Prior work on algorithmic truth assessment on unreliable content, has mostly pursued binary classifiers - factual vs. fake - and disregarded the finer shades of untruth.

Social media appeals to users due to its fast dissemination of information, low cost, and easy access. However, social media also enables the widespread of fake news. Because of the detrimental societal effects of fake news, detecting fake news has attracted increasing attention. However, the detection performance only using news contents is generally not satisfactory as fake news is written to mimic true news. Thus, there is a need for an in-depth understanding on the relationship between user profiles on social media and fake news. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of understanding and exploiting user profiles on social media for fake news detection. In an attempt to understand connections between user profiles and fake news, first, we measure users' sharing behaviors on social media and group representative users who are more likely to share fake and real news; then, we perform a comparative analysis of explicit and implicit profile features between these user groups, which reveals their potential to help differentiate fake news from real news. To exploit user profile features, we demonstrate the usefulness of these user profile features in a fake news classification task.

That is, they only concentrate on optimizing the number of nodes. However, the interaction effects between nodes differ from user to user and the related profit obtained from interaction activities may also be different. This article proposes a novel problem, called profit minimization of misinformation (PMM), which is the first to analyze the profit of activity in the MC problem. Given a misinformation seed set, the PMM problem aims at selecting a node set satisfying the cardinality constraint to minimize the profit of edges starting from infected nodes but ending at infected or protected nodes. Based on the sandwich method, we design a data-dependent approximation scheme for the PMM problem. We approximate the upper and lower bounds of the objective in the equivalent problem by the reverse influence sampling technique. Our algorithm is verified on realistic data sets, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.', 215.666666666667, 1, 0.0344086021505376, 2.17054237016082e-05), (2947382865, 'Countering Russian Disinformation', 'Timothy P.

In addition, fake news is being produced and the problem of social polarization is becoming serious.

We carried out an extensive comparison of these networks using several alignment-free approaches including basic network properties, centrality measures distributions, and network distances. We accordingly evaluated to what extent these features allow to discriminate between the networks associated to the aforementioned news domains.

The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify the misinformation present in online direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of SCT targeting patients with musculoskeletal disease in the U.S. It was hypothesized that DTC advertising of SCT contains substantial misinformation. METHODS A list of keywords was used to identify web sites of practices advertising SCT directly to patients with musculoskeletal disease. Web sites were evaluated to determine the specialties of providers offering SCT, types of SCT being advertised, and misinformation presented. Categories of misinformation included false general claims, inaccurate statements regarding mechanism of action, unfounded results, and scare tactics. RESULTS Of the 896 practice web sites included in the analysis, 95.9% contained at least 1 statement of misinformation, with a mean of 4.65 ± 3.66 statements of misinformation among the sites. Practices associated with an orthopaedic surgeon provided 22% fewer statements of misinformation than practices without an orthopaedic surgeon when we controlled for the effects of other specialties. Practices associated with a podiatrist also provided 22% fewer statements of misinformation. CONCLUSIONS Nearly all practices failed to accurately represent the clinical efficacy of SCT in DTC advertising.

In a similar manner to an epidemic, it spreads between humans via digital and physical information systems. It makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. Objective A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation on responding to the infodemic related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was held, entirely online, to crowdsource suggested actions for a framework for infodemic management. Methods A group of policy makers, public health professionals, researchers, students, and other concerned stakeholders was joined by representatives of the media, social media platforms, various private sector organizations, and civil society to suggest and discuss actions for all parts of society, and multiple related professional and scientific disciplines, methods, and technologies. A total of 594 ideas for actions were crowdsourced online during the discussions and consolidated into suggestions for an infodemic management framework. Results The analysis team distilled the suggestions into a set of 50 proposed actions for a framework for managing infodemics in health emergencies. The consultation revealed six policy implications to consider. First, interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence, and must reach citizens and enable them to make informed decisions on how to protect themselves and their communities in a health emergency. Second, knowledge should be translated into actionable behavior-change messages, presented in ways that are understood by and accessible to all individuals in all parts of all societies. Third, governments should reach out to key communities to ensure their concerns and information needs are understood, tailoring advice and messages to address the audiences they represent. Fourth, to strengthen the analysis and amplification of information impact, strategic partnerships should be formed across all sectors, including but not limited to the social media and technology sectors, academia, and civil society. Fifth, health authorities should ensure that these actions are informed by reliable information that helps them understand the circulating narratives and changes in the flow of information, questions, and misinformation in communities. Sixth, following experiences to date in responding to the COVID-19 infodemic and the lessons from other disease outbreaks, infodemic management approaches should be further developed to support preparedness and response, and to inform risk mitigation, and be enhanced through data science and sociobehavioral and other research. Conclusions The first version of this framework proposes five action areas in which WHO Member States and actors within society can apply, according to their mandate, an infodemic management approach adapted to national contexts and practices.

The misinformation prevention problem aims at generating a positive cascade with appropriate seed nodes in order to compete against the misinformation. In this paper, we study the misinformation prevention problem under the prominent independent cascade model. Due to the #{P}-hardness in computing influence, the core problem is to design effective sampling methods to estimate the function value. The main contribution of this paper is a novel sampling method. Different from the classic reverse sampling technique which treats all nodes equally and samples the node uniformly, the proposed method proceeds with a hybrid sampling process which is able to attach high weights to the users who are prone to be affected by the misinformation. Consequently, the new sampling method is more powerful in generating effective samples used for computing seed nodes for the positive cascade. Based on the new hybrid sample technique, we design an algorithm offering a $(1-1/e-\\epsilon)-$ approximation.

However, the detection performance only using news contents is generally not satisfactory as fake news is written to mimic true news.

To exploit user profile features, we demonstrate the usefulness of these user profile features in a fake news classification task.

Despite extensive research findings on the long-term effects and consequences of child sexual abuse, misinformation on this topic is widespread. Several forces have worked to support and disseminate this erroneous information. Because it is difficult to comprehend the horror of sexual crimes against children, society's denial and disbelief have often unwittingly supported the agendas of those who want to discount or minimize the impact of these crimes. The media has also contributed to the aura of skepticism surrounding claims of sexual abuse and its mental health impact, and has reported favorably on controversial and unproven claims such as the “false memory syndrome”. In the hope of countering misinformation and thus raising the level of discourse to the engagement of real scientific issues, a number of well known and respected researchers and clinicians examine various facets of the problem.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (3022835860, 'Parental Alienation and Misinformation Proliferation', 'William Bernet ', 2020, 3, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2963898544, 'Fake or Visual Trickery?

RESULTS: The videos about e-cigarettes and hookahs led to more positive attitudes toward the featured products than did control videos. However, these effects did not fully translate into attitudes toward combustive cigarette smoking, although the pipe video led to more positive attitudes toward combustive smoking than did the chewing and the hookah videos, and the e-cigarette video led to more positive attitudes toward combustive cigarette smoking than did the chewing video.

This study used auditory evoked fields (AEFs) to address the question of whether neural correlates of sensory auditory information processing differ in youth with OCD compared with healthy comparison subjects (HCS). AEFs, recorded with a whole head 275-channel magnetoencephalography system, were elicited in response to binaural auditory stimuli from 10 pediatric subjects with OCD (ages 8–13, mean 11 years, 6 males) and 10 age- and gender-matched HCS. Three major neuromagnetic responses were studied: M70 (60–80 ms), M100 (90–120 ms), and M150 (130–190 ms). When compared with HCS, subjects with OCD demonstrated delayed latency of the M100 response. In subjects with OCD the amplitude of the M100 and M150 responses was significantly greater in the right hemisphere compared with the left hemisphere. Current results suggest that when compared with HCS, subjects with OCD have altered auditory information processing, evident from the delayed latency of the M100 response, which is thought to be associated with the encoding of physical stimulus characteristics. Interhemispheric asymmetry with increased M100 and M150 amplitudes over the right hemisphere compared with the left hemisphere was found in young OCD subjects.

RESULTS: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%] and 86 [67.2%]). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions.

We propose a heuristic-containing (HC) strategy based on optimizing the final outbreak size that outperforms simplified strategies such as those that are random-containing and targeted-containing. We verify the effectiveness of our HC strategy on both artificial and real-world networks by performing extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. We find that the HC strategy dramatically increases the outbreak threshold and decreases the final outbreak threshold.Many researchers from a variety of fields, including computer science, network science, and mathematics, have focused on how to contain the outbreaks of Internet misinformation that threaten social systems and undermine societal health. Most research on this topic treats the connections among individuals as static, but these connections change in time, and thus social networks are also temporal networks.

In this context, the ability to link multiple accounts or profiles that spread such malicious content on the Internet while hiding in anonymity would enable proactive identification and blacklisting.

In this work, we have analyzed how the latest advances in keystroke biometric recognition can help to link behavioral typing patterns in experiments involving 100,000 users and more than 1 million typed sequences.

Bracey ', 2008, 3, 'About 120,000 8th graders taking algebra have math skills at the 2nd-grade level--at best. My guess is that there are hundreds of thousands more in those algebra courses whose skills are not much better. This is because of a widespread belief that algebra is a "gateway" course. We get to the 120,000 figure via Brookings Institution researcher Tom Loveless, who worked with National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) limited-use data, which allow researchers to drill down to the individual student level in analyses. Loveless finds that the number of low achievers, students who make up the bottom 10% of NAEP scorers, increased from 3% of those tested in 2000 to 7.8% in (2005.) The latter percent yields the figure of 120,000. I imagine that the next 10% also didn\'t fare well. Loveless figures this number means the average 8th-grade algebra teacher with 26 students has two students who, essentially, don\'t know any math. He calls them "misplaced" students. "The misplaced 8th graders score an average of 211 [on NAEP], which is 27 scale score points below the national average for 4th grade. Analysts consider 11 NAEP scale points as about equivalent to one year of learning, which means that these misplaced students know about as much as a typical 2nd grader. Advanced students (the top 10% in Loveless\' scheme) score about one year above grade level. The misplaced students function about seven grade levels below peers in the same courses." The overall 8th-grade average on NAEP is 279; for students at the top, it is 291. Loveless presents a couple of NAEP released item results to indicate the scope of the problem. Here they are: There were 90 employees in a company last year. This year, the number of employees increased by 10%. How many employees are in the company this year? While 48.7% of students in advanced courses answered correctly, only 9.8% of misplaced students did. That is far less than chance. Alba needed to know about how much the sum of 19.6, 23.8, and 38.4 is. She correctly rounded each of these numbers to the nearest whole number. What three numbers did she use? Almost 88% of advanced students answered correctly, but only 37% of misplaced students got it right. Loveless also presents data for three more nonreleased items that show similar results, including one where 57% of advanced students responded correctly, compared to only 3.9% of misplaced students. Loveless describes the typical rationale for 8th-grade algebra: "General or remedial math courses tend to be curricular dead-ends, leading to more courses with the same title (for example, General Math 9, General Math 10) and no real progression in mathematical content. By completing algebra in 8th grade--and then completing a sequence of geometry as freshmen, advanced algebra as sophomores, and trigonometry, math analysis, or pre-calculus as juniors--students are able to take calculus in the senior year of high school." Assuming, of course, that the kids haven\'t dropped out, frustrated to tears by incomprehensible math. Loveless presents no arguments that all students should take algebra or calculus. But he does make the case that learning algebra is a civil rights issue, particularly as presented by the Algebra Project\'s Robert Moses in a paper for the U. S. Department of Education, Algebra: The New Civil Right. Evidence for a civil rights dynamic comes from looking at the background characteristics of the misplaced students: They are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic (77% vs. 32% of all 8th graders) and likely to qualify for a free or reduced-price meal (70% vs. 30% in all advanced classes and 36% in the nation). Most of the misplaced students attend large urban public schools (average size 1,012 student vs. 794 in the nation).

Thus, we predicted that brief stress immediately before learning would decrease participants' susceptibility to subsequent misinformation and reduce false memory formation. Eighty-four male and female participants submerged their hand in ice cold (stress) or warm (no stress) water for 3\xa0min.

Seventy-five participants watched a video that included nine randomized details. After a ten-minute retention phase, the subjects read a narrative text. Six out of the nine details were replaced by misleading details. Following this, the participants completed a cued recall task for three of the original items.

He argues that the label should more accurately say, “according to statistics, there is a certain probability of developing lung cancer through smoking, above all in people with a genetic predisposition. But nevertheless, there are cases … of hardened smokers who have not developed lung cancer.”1(p1198) Such a statement ignores the evidence that about half of lifelong smokers will die prematurely from tobacco-caused diseases,2 and that tobacco-caused heart disease kills far more people than does lung cancer, the most common among the many tobacco-caused cancers.3 What role genetics plays is unknown, but it is clearly insufficient to independently cause lung cancer in any appreciable numbers. Claiming that some smokers do not develop lung cancer is arguing from exception, minimizing the likelihood of only one type of tobacco-caused death, and distracting readers from the more critical point. In debate, the name usually given to that device is smokescreen.\r\n\r\nTuroldo also asserts that, to help “individuals make informed decisions rather than limiting choices… . The effects of smoking tobacco products are listed on cigarette packets.”1(p1199) Actually, in most countries very few of the diseases tobacco causes are listed on packs.\r\n\r\nTuroldo claims that tobacco is “subject to heavy taxation in almost all countries worldwide.”1(p1200) While “heavy” is subject to interpretation, the World Health Organization regards tobacco taxes as “low in the overwhelming majority of countries.”4(p54) In more than 30 countries, the real price of local cigarettes decreased between 2002 and 2007.5 In one quarter of World Health Organization–surveyed countries, tobacco taxes accounted for less than 25% of the pack price, and only 4 countries, representing 2% of the world's people, have rates more than 75% of the price, as recommended. Among low and middle- income countries, major targets of the multinational tobacco industry, less than one quarter tax tobacco at 50% or more of retail price.5\r\n\r\nFinally, Turoldo asserts that the tobacco industry is among those with an important role in delivering public health.

However, the findings are limited by their reliance on behavioral measures. This study investigates the role of difficulty in disengaging attention from suicide-relevant stimuli using the P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs). Methods Forty-four adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were administered the spatial cueing task using suicide-relevant and negatively-valenced words as cue stimuli. Disengagement difficulty was measured using reaction time and P300 during invalid trials. Results P300 amplitudes at Pz were higher in suicide-relevant compared to negatively-valenced word condition on invalid trials for participants with low rates of suicidal behavior. However, no such difference was found among participants with high rates of suicidal behavior. P300 amplitudes for suicide-relevant word condition were negatively correlated with “lifetime suicide ideation and attempt” at Pz.

Our objective was to determine to what extent health food stores would recommend and/or sell creatine and testosterone boosters to a 15-year-old boy customer. METHODS: Research personnel posing as 15-year-old high school athletes seeking to increase muscle strength contacted 244 health food stores in the United States via telephone. Researchers asked the sales attendant what supplements he/she would recommend. If a sales attendant did not mention creatine or testosterone boosters initially, each of these supplements was then specifically asked about. Supplement recommendations were recorded. Sales attendants were also asked if a 15-year-old could purchase these products on his own in the store. RESULTS: A total of 67.2% (164/244) of sales attendants recommended creatine: 38.5% (94/244) recommended creatine without prompting, and an additional 28.7% (70/244) recommended creatine after being asked specifically about it. A total of 9.8% (24/244) of sales attendants recommended a testosterone booster.

CONCLUSIONS: Health food store employees frequently recommend creatine and testosterone boosters for boy high school athletes.

Whereas some researchers believe that this so-called continued influence effect of misinformation (CIEM) simply arises from the insufficient encoding and integration of corrective claims, others assume that it arises from a competition between the correct information and the initial misinformation in memory. To examine these possibilities, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In each study, participants were asked to (a) read a series of brief news reports that contained confirmations or corrections of prior information and (b) evaluate whether subsequently presented memory probes matched the reports' correct facts rather than the initial misinformation. Both studies revealed that following correction-containing news reports, participants struggled to refute mismatching memory probes, especially when they referred to initial misinformation (as opposed to mismatching probes with novel information). We found little evidence, however, that the encoding of confirmations and corrections produced systematic neural processing differences indicative of distinct encoding strategies. Instead, we discovered that following corrections, participants exhibited increased activity in the left angular gyrus and the bilateral precuneus in response to mismatching memory probes that contained prior misinformation, compared to novel mismatch probes.

Hence, detection of fake news is an emerging problem that has become extremely prevalent during the last few years. Most existing works on this topic focus on manual feature extraction and supervised classification models leveraging a large number of labeled (fake or real) articles. In contrast, we focus on content-based detection of fake news articles, while assuming that we have a small amount of labels, made available by manual fact-checkers or automated sources. We argue this is a more realistic setting in the presence of massive amounts of content, most of which cannot be easily factchecked. To that end, we represent collections of news articles as multi-dimensional tensors, leverage tensor decomposition to derive concise article embeddings that capture spatial/contextual information about each news article, and use those embeddings to create an article-by-article graph on which we propagate limited labels. Results on three real-world datasets show that our method performs on par or better than existing models that are fully supervised, in that we achieve better detection accuracy using fewer labels. In particular, our proposed method achieves 75.43% of accuracy using only 30% of labels of a public dataset while an SVM-based classifier achieved 67.43%.

While we are aware that disinformation campaigns exist, detecting their online presence is still difficult. Researchers have proposed detecting disinformation campaigns on Twitter by looking for specific coordination patterns (e.g., sharing the same hashtag in a short time frame). The problem with this approach, however, is that while the proposed coordination patterns may have been unique to the studied disinformation campaigns, the patterns have not been thoroughly validated against non-random samples or across a diverse set of campaigns. We examine the usefulness of these coordination patterns for identifying the activity of a disinformation campaign from other Twitter activity. We do this by testing the proposed coordination patterns on a large-scale dataset of ten state-attributed campaigns and various benign Twitter communities likely to coordinate and share information amongst themselves. We show that such patterns have significant limitations. First, coordination in Twitter communities is not uncommon, especially when the online world is reacting to real-world news (e.g., US impeachment trials). Second, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that political bodies increased their coordinated activity. Such surge in coordination worsens the trade-off between usability and rate of detection. To identify most of the benign activity during the pandemic, the classifier misses nearly 25% of disinformation activity. Conversely, if the classifier achieves a high rate of detection for malicious coordination, it misclassifies 46% of legitimate coordinated activity.

Gackowski ', 2006, 2, 'Introduction Eli Cohen (1999) defines informing sciences as "the field of inquiry that attempts to provide a client with information in a form, format, and schedule that maximizes its effectiveness" (p.5). This paper examines the dynamic process of informing with respect to the credibility of its content (information value) in addition to the form and format that play an indirect role in determining its quality. In contrast to a different paper, "Quality of informing: Credibility--a provisional model of functional dependencies," this one focuses on the philosophical background and the inherent roots of bias and disinformation. They are the greatest risks associated with informing. Thoughts about mitigation strategies are discussed. According to Eli Cohen, bias is a failure to fully inform, and disinforming is reporting untrue information as true, with knowledge that it is not true. Its purpose is to deceive. This inquiry attempts to identify the underlying cause(s) of bias and disinformation and to demonstrate that bias is more than "failure to fully inform." The latter is the least harmful kind of bias, which is caused by ignorance, and belongs to misinforming, which is not a subject of this paper. This inquiry deals with the bias rooted in human nature, in its subconscious and intentions, which make it part of disinforming. This paper refers to the theoretical operations research-based approach to informing and to operations quality of data and information values as proposed by Gackowski (2004; 2005a; 2005b). The philosophical background and roots of bias and disinformation are based on Schopenhauer\'s opus vitae, "The world as will and representation," which was critically presented to English readers by Hamlyn (1980). The main contributions of this paper are * the modified concepts of informing * the role of credibility in passive informing * the role of credibility in active informing where bias and disinformation reign * some thoughts about mitigating disinformation and intentional bias For focused reading, key terms in paragraphs are in bold font, emphasis in italics, highest emphasis underlined, and terms followed by a definition in bold italics. Informing Systems as We Know Concepts of Informing In Nadler\'s (1970) terminology on work systems, "informing systems are a class of work systems whose basic output is information that affects recipients\' actions" as defined by Gackowski (1982, p. 108). Since that time, a separate discipline of informing science emerged that was fostered by the incessant efforts of the Informing Science Institute, led by Eli Cohen, with an established tradition of annual international conferences, journals, and other forms of publication not horded by always shared on the Web. Informing models comprise basic components: information source(s), communication channel( s), and informed entities. In informing science, the latter are referred to as clients. In the conventional meaning of the term in commerce, networked computers, or program objects, however, they may not always be clients. The term "entities informed" renders better their role and position in informing. Information sources may be active or passive. * Active information sources--informing entities by their nature or design transmit, disseminate, or broadcast signals conveying information. When by design, sources are active agents--senders or disseminators of information, such as advertisers, professional information providers, politicians, preachers, etc.--the entities inform or try to affect them in a desired manner. * Passive information sources yield information when observed, examined, and/or measured. Communications channels link information sources and entities informed. The sets and sequences of signal transformations constitute the informing processes. They may be performed by any component of the informing model: informing entities, and/or communication channels, and/or entities informed. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2797666407, 'Seeing Through Misinformation: A Framework for Identifying Fake Online News.', 'Murphy Choy , Mark Chong ', 2018, 2, 'The fake news epidemic makes it imperative to develop a diagnostic framework that is both parsimonious and valid to guide present and future efforts in fake news detection.

Decision makers can falsely remember the gist as seen or heard even when they remember verbatim facts. Indeed, misinformation can be more compelling than information when it provides an interpretation of reality that makes better sense than the facts. Consequently, for many issues, scientific information and misinformation are in a battle for the gist. A fuzzy-processing preference for simple gist explains expectations for antibiotics, the spread of misinformation about vaccination, and responses to messages about global warming, nuclear proliferation, and natural disasters. The gist, which reflects knowledge and experience, induces emotions and brings to mind social values. However, changing mental representations is not sufficient by itself; gist representations must be connected to values. The policy choice is not simply between constraining behavior or persuasion—there is another option. Science communication needs to shift from an emphasis on disseminating rote facts to achieving insight, retaining its integrity but without shying away from emotions and values.', 332.76075036075, 1, 0.00284495021337127, 2.30846061664045e-05), (2800239408, 'Toward relational learning with misinformation', 'Liang Wu (Arizona State University), Jundong Li (Arizona State University), Fred Morstatter (University of Southern California), Huan Liu (IAFSE-SEMTE: Adaptive Intelligent Materials and Systems Center (AIMS))', 2018, 2, '', 15.666666666666698, 1, 0.0, 2.13642039706015e-05), (2795989046, 'Fact-checking vs. Fake news: Periodismo de confirmación como componente de la competencia mediática contra la desinformación', 'Gabriel Lotero-Echeverri (Pontifical Bolivarian University), Luis M.

However, it also facilitates the generation and propagation of fake news, which could cause detrimental societal consequences. Detecting fake news on microblogs is important for societal good. Emotion is considered a significant indicator in many fake news detection studies, and most of them utilize emotion mainly through users stances or simple statistical emotional features. In reality, the publishers typically post either a piece of news with intense emotion which could easily resonate with the crowd, or a controversial statement unemotionally aiming to evoke intense emotion among the users. However, existing studies that exploiting the emotion information from both news content and user comments corporately is ignored. Therefore, in this paper, we study the novel problem of learning dual emotion for fake news detection. We propose a new Dual Emotion-based fAke News detection framework (DEAN), which can i) learn content- and comment- emotion representations for publishers and users respectively; and ii) exploit the dual emotion representations simultaneously for fake news detection.

For this reason, several approaches for fake news detection in microblogging have been proposed up to now, mostly based on machine learning techniques.

Here, so-called ‘fake news’ are of focus. These are considered problematic, particularly in a high-choice media environment as users tend to show selective behaviour. Much research has demonstrated this selective exposure approach, which has roots in the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger, 1957). However, research on the processes of coping with dissonance is still considered sparse. In particular, communication scholars have overlooked emotional states and negotiations. This article analyses the affects that are aroused when users are confronted with opinion-challenging disinformation and how they (emotionally) cope by using different strategies for online information. For this, we used the context of climate change that is widely accepted in Germany. The innovative research design included pre- and post-survey research, stimulus exposure (denying ‘fake news’), observations, and retrospective interviews (n = 50). Through this, we find that perceptions and coping strategies vary individually and that overt behaviour, such as searching for counter-arguments, should be seen against the background of individual ideas and motivations, such as believing in an easy rejection of arguments. Confirming neuroscientific findings, participants felt relieved and satisfied once they were able to dissolve their dissonant state and negative arousal.

This includes the spread of misinformation, which has been documented within the context of the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the creation, spread and uptake of social media misinformation is of critical importance to public safety. In this descriptive study, we detail Twitter activity regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and claims it increases, or “boosts”, immunity. Spinal manipulation is a common intervention used by many health professions, most commonly by chiropractors. There is no clinical evidence that SMT improves human immunity. Social media searching software (Talkwalker Quick Search) was used to describe Twitter activity regarding SMT and improving or boosting immunity. Searches were performed for the 3\u2009months and 12\u2009months before March 31, 2020 using terms related to 1) SMT, 2) the professions that most often provide SMT and 3) immunity. From these searches, we determined the magnitude and time course of Twitter activity then coded this activity into content that promoted or refuted a SMT/immunity link. Content themes, high-influence users and user demographics were then stratified as either promoting or refuting this linkage. Twitter misinformation regarding a SMT/immunity link increased dramatically during the onset of the COVID crisis. Activity levels (number of tweets) and engagement scores (likes + retweets) were roughly equal between content promoting or refuting a SMT/immunity link, however, the potential reach (audience) of tweets refuting a SMT/immunity link was 3 times higher than those promoting a link. Users with the greatest influence on Twitter, as either promoters or refuters, were individuals, not institutions or organizations. The majority of tweets promoting a SMT/immunity link were generated in the USA while the majority of refuting tweets originated from Canada.

As a first step of fighting with fake news, this paper characterizes hundreds of popular fake and real news measured by shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook from two perspectives: Web sites and content. Our site analysis reveals that the Web sites of the fake and real news publishers exhibit diverse registration behaviors and registration timing. In addition, fake news tends to disappear from the Web after a certain amount of time. The content characterizations on the fake and real news corpus suggest that simply applying term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is inefficient in detecting fake news, while exploring document similarity with the term and word vectors is a very promising direction for predicting fake and real news.

Thus, as a way of delivering misinformation the participants ostensibly became their own source of the misleading information.

RESULTS: A Google Scholar search identified 33 references that incorrectly cite the Bryant and White article as the first description of a case of calciphylaxis.

Electroencephalography was recorded while 15 adults with GAD and 15 age-matched controls viewed angry and neutral faces prior to individual trials of a flanker task.

Results showed reduced discrimination between aversive and non-aversive faces and responses in the GAD relative to the control group during visual discrimination (N170) and later-emerging error monitoring (Pe).

The ease of access and sharing the data with the revolution in mobile technology has led to the proliferation of fake news. Fake news has the potential to manipulate public opinions and hence, may harm society. Thus, it is necessary to examine the credibility and authenticity of the news articles being shared on social media. Nowadays, the problem of fake news has gained massive attention from research communities and needed an optimal solution with high efficiency and low efficacy. Existing detection methods are based on either news-content or social-context using user-based features as an individual. In this paper, the content of the news article and the existence of echo chambers (community of social media-based users sharing the same opinions) in the social network are taken into account for fake news detection. A tensor representing social context (correlation between user profiles on social media and news articles) is formed by combining the news, user and community information. The news content is fused with the tensor, and coupled matrix-tensor factorization is employed to get a representation of both news content and social context. The proposed method has been tested on a real-world dataset: BuzzFeed. The factors obtained after decomposition have been used as features for news classification. An ensemble machine learning classifier (XGBoost) and a deep neural network model (DeepFakE) are employed for the task of classification.

Social media platforms enable the rapid spread of such misinformation and also make evaluating the credibility of online information more difficult. Since college students are frequent users of social media, they are particularly likely to be exposed to fake news. A survey was conducted with 63 undergraduate students in which they identified and evaluated examples of both fake and real news stories and reported their associated information behaviors. Results showed correlations between accurate identification of fake news stories and specific critical evaluation behaviors and strategies. However, students were unable to accurately evaluate their own skills, and their willingness to share fake news stories on social media was not related to accurate identifications or evaluations of trustworthiness. This study contributes to the understanding of not just how accurately students evaluate fake news stories, but of the specific information-seeking behaviors and critical evaluation strategies that are associated with accurate identifications and evaluations and with willingness to share news stories on social media.

Young and older adults viewed one of two slide sequences, each containing context-consistent items (e.g., a blender in a kitchen setting or a saw in a woodshop setting) and context-inconsistent items (a saw in a kitchen setting or a blender in a woodshop setting). After receiving misinformation through post-event narratives, participants received tests of yes/no recognition requiring remember/know judgments (Experiments 1–3) and source monitoring (Experiments 2 and 3) for slide details. Although age-related differences in the misinformation effect were nonreliable, older adults tended to report misinformation as remembered more often than young adults, and source monitoring tests reduced the misinformation effect for both age groups. Misinformation effects were equivalent or larger for inconsistent objects than for consistent objects. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.

Bond ', 2000, 2, "I n the past half century, the number of people fed by a single U.S. farmer has grown from 19 to 129. Despite this stunning advance, intractable health and nutrition problems remain. The world's population continues to grow even as available farmland shrinks. Preventable illnesses and malnutrition still claim the lives of many children in the developing world. As the new millennium gets under way, policy-makers, health care professionals, scientists, and others are searching for the tools to meet the increasing demands of a growing and changing world. Chief among these tools is biotechnology. Leading scientists have concluded that, although still in its infancy, biotechnology has breathtaking possibilities for improving human health and nutrition and that a satisfactory regulatory system is in place to govern its development.\n\nDespite this consensus, a vocal, aggressive—and in some cases, lawless—group of advocacy organizations seeks to discredit and eliminate biotechnology. At issue is the alleged risk that any genetically modified plant may pose to the environment. However, the issue of risk is by no means one-sided. Yes, we must understand whether transgenic corn poses more risk to the Monarch butterfly than does the existing practice of using synthetic chemicals. However, the greater risk, in my view, is that without a scientific basis, the naysayers may succeed in their goal of subverting biotechnology and thus condemn the world's children to unnecessary malnutrition, blindness, sickness, and environmental degradation.\n\nAlthough positive change is to the collective long-term benefit of us all, it typically results in short-term difficulties, anxiety, and fear for some. Opposition of the sort I witnessed at firsthand while at the December 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, Washington, has been driven variously by trade-protectionist and anticorporate sentiment, by competing food marketers such as the whole-foods industry, and by scientifically unsubstantiated fears of change and technology. Some of those who seek to undermine biotechnology are not interested in seeking information or constructive dialogue. Some in Europe have adopted a constrained trade policy that consists of exporting little more than hysteria, which we can expect to energize the professional political ambulance-chasers here in the United States. Sadly, the actions of radicals such as those who recently vandalized test plots in California and set fire to research offices at Michigan State University are not harmless pranks; rather, such tactics lead to diminished public understanding of the benefits versus the risks of biotechnology.\n\nDiminished understanding is key to obstructing biotechnology. In discussions of fact, the scientific viewpoint will prevail. However, public education will remain challenging. Given the nature of the modern media, will scientists have to start dressing up as corncobs, as some protestors have done, to get media attention? During the past 2 years, I have asked scientists to work with their local media representatives and public officials to help them separate fact from fiction. After the problems in Seattle, it is clear that much more must be done. We must work diligently to ensure that consumers, who drive food production, are adequately informed about the science supporting the uses of biotechnology. Input from the scientific community is vital, but we cannot count on the media to find scientists; scientists must actively seek to influence the media. As we work to counteract the naysayers, we should be encouraged that most Americans, and many others in developed countries, embrace technological advances and are generally receptive to the benefits that new technologies bring to their lives.\n\nA protocol for an international agreement regarding trade of genetically engineered products has just been released. Although full understanding of the implications of the agreement will not precede its implementation, we can all hope that it will serve to better inform all citizens and depoliticize the process in favor of science-based decision-making.\n\nThe development of this technology is not recreational. Through biotechnology, scientists are attempting to solve the real-world problems of sickness, hunger, and resource depletion. The hysteria and unworkable propositions advanced by those who can afford to take their next meal for granted have little currency among those who are hungry.

Perception, as this article demonstrates, was everything at court, since false rumors that individual courtiers would be granted offices or would soon fall from power had a self-fulfilling potential. While contemporaries were quick to assume that rumors were spread deliberately, this paper demonstrates that such false reports were sometimes mere speculation and wishful thinking passed on as fact.

By applying specific contrasts, this allowed us to disentangle pure effects of 3 kinds of salience, namely targetness (targets vs. nontargets), deviance (nontargets vs. standards), and novelty (novels vs. nontargets). Distinct effects of targetness, deviance and novelty across several components were found. At the behavioral level, no group differences between adults with and without ADHD were observed. Contrary to our expectations, no difference between groups was found for the P3b amplitude to targets or the novelty P3 to nontargets and novels; however, in adults with ADHD a clear P3b to novels was apparent, which was absent in controls. This latter finding indicates deficient attention allocation in adults with ADHD, more specifically increased sustained processing of task-irrelevant novel events.

The hidden nature of the target population necessitated outreach recruitment techniques, including the use of social media, newspaper articles, radio interviews, and contact with major family support organizations. Data were collected using a cross-sectional design and international online survey. The PCL-C (PTSD), the PHQ-8 (MDD), and PG-13 (PGD) were used to measure mental health disorders.

Our domain reputation analysis reveals that the Web sites of the fake and real news publishers exhibit diverse registration behaviors, registration timing, domain rankings, and domain popularity. In addition, fake news tends to disappear from the Web after a certain amount of time. The content characterizations on the fake and real news corpus suggest that simply applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling is inefficient in detecting fake news, while exploring document similarity with the term and word vectors is a very promising direction for predicting fake and real news.

Mencken, laments the fact that the 75th anniversary of the introduction of the bathtub to the United States had passed without the slightest public notice. “Not a plumber fired a salute or hung out a flag. Not a governor proclaimed a day of prayer. Not a newspaper called attention to the day” (1). Mencken goes on to detail the history of the bathtub, describing the introduction of the English bathtub by Lord John Russell in 1828, “then, as now … a puny and inconvenient contrivance—little more, in fact, than a glorified dishpan.” Mencken wrote that installation of the bathtub in Millard Fillmore's White House in 1851 led to more widespread acceptance in the United States. Quoting from the purported April 23, 1843, issue of Western Medical Repository , he goes on to record the opposition of physicians to the bathtub as dangerous to health, inviting “phthisic, rheumatic fevers, inflammation of the lungs, and the whole category of zygomatic diseases.” And he states that by 1859 the majority of the medical community had finally accepted the bathtub as harmless to health—evidenced by a poll taken at the 1859 meeting of American Medical Association in Boston, in which nearly 55% of physicians regarded the bathtub as harmless and more than 20% advocated its use as beneficial to health (1).\n\n\n\nThe spread of misinformation in science and medicine is a real problem, not only in spite of technology but often because of it.

This is especially true of news stories shared on social media since they don't undergo any stringent journalistic checking associated with main stream media. Given the inherent human tendency to share information with their social connections at a mouse-click, fake news articles masquerading as real ones, tend to spread widely and virally. The presence of echo chambers (people sharing same beliefs) in social networks, only adds to this problem of wide-spread existence of fake news on social media. In this paper, we tackle the problem of fake news detection from social media by exploiting the very presence of echo chambers that exist within the social network of users to obtain an efficient and informative latent representation of the news article. By modeling the echo-chambers as closely-connected communities within the social network, we represent a news article as a 3-mode tensor of the structure - and propose a tensor factorization based method to encode the news article in a latent embedding space preserving the community structure. We also propose an extension of the above method, which jointly models the community and content information of the news article through a coupled matrix-tensor factorization framework. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method for the task of Fake News Detection over two real-world datasets.

They believed that telling a complete history might cause providers to verbally abuse them and they would be regarded in a negative light. Examples of the information controlled included concealing the actual number of children or self-induced abortions. The women adopted this behaviour as a resistance strategy to mitigate providers’ disrespectful treatment through verbal abuses and questioning women’s practices that contradicted providers’ biomedical ideologies. Secondly, they utilised this strategy to evade public humiliation because of inadequate privacy in the hospitals. The withheld information affected quality of care decision-making and care provision processes and outcomes, since misinformed providers were unaware of particular women’s risk profile. Many mothers in this study withhold or misinform providers about their obstetric, reproductive and social information as a way to avoid receiving disrespectful maternal care and protect their privacy. Improving provider client relationship skills, empowering clients and providing adequate infrastructure to ensure privacy and confidentiality in hospitals, are critical to the provision of respectful maternal care.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2911320438, 'Building Knowledge Graphs About Political Agents in the Age of Misinformation.', 'Daniel Schwabe , Carlos Laufer , Antonio Busson ', 2019, 1, 'This paper presents the construction of a Knowledge Graph about relations between agents in a political system.

Fake news may be fabricated for the purpose of, commercial gain, political propaganda, seeking attention, and intent of defamation. Interest of individuals, and various groups to influence events and policies around the globe is the other reason for fake news generation and dissemination. The extensive spread of fake news is progressively becoming a threat to individuals and society as a whole. It disrupts the authenticity balance of the news ecosystem; induces biased or false beliefs into consumers; creates real-life fears in the society and threatens freedom of speech, freedom of the press and democracy. The craving to mitigate the undesirable effects of fake news, recently makes fake news detection on social media an emerging research area attracting tremendous attention. Following this warm concern, various researches have been conducted and showed promising results. In this work, we propose a model for early detection of fake news using deep learning, and news content. Deep learning and heterogeneous dataset has been used to create a more generic model that could perform better in the real world. We conducted experiments on two real world datasets and a third dataset which is obtained by combining the two datasets and randomly shuffled them.

In 2008, in the United Kingdom, malicious hoax calls to the fire brigade cost taxpayers more than $73m per annum (Nugent & Sidders 2008) and in Queensland, malicious hoax calls comprise three percent of all call-outs. This includes a 1.4 percent increase over the period 2002 to 2007 (QFRS 2008). Suspicious fires also have a significant impact. The New South Wales Fire Service reported a $38m annual cost associated with property loss (NSWFB 1994) and it is suggested that suspicious fires account for roughly half of all vegetation fires reported in Australia (Bryant 2008). Flowever, very little is known about the dynamics of either malicious hoax calls or suspicious fires, even though they are prosecutable offences. While some studies find that malicious hoax calls and suspicious fires are more prevalent in economically disadvantaged areas (Corcoran, Higgs & Fligginson 2010; Flirschfield & Bowers 2004), to date, international research has not explored the micro-geographical dynamics of these incidents or their evolution overtime. Adopting a micro-geographic approach can identify persistent, transient and emergent dynamics of hotspots that can be used to inform optimal resource allocation in anticipation of likely load.Recent studies in criminology demonstrate that crime has distinct and disguisable spatial dimensions (eg see Morenoff, Sampson & Raudenbush 2001). Neighbourhoods near or next to other criminogenic places are likely to experience more crime, whereas neighbourhoods further away experience less crime. Therefore, incidents of crime and disorder have spill-over effects. Put another way, contiguous areas influence each other in ways that either prevent or facilitate crime and disorder.Until recently, the goal of criminological research has been to explain away or control these spatial dependencies. Flowever, as Townsley (2009: 453) argues, through the theoretical advances of environmental criminology, the 'spatial structure of areas and their respective adjacency to other areas' are slowly becoming central points of interest in their own right.Studies in criminology largely focus on the more traditionally investigated offences such as homicide or drug use to the exclusion of other types of offences that may also cause social harm to society. This paper redresses this gap in previous research by placing the location of the offences at the centre of empirical investigations. For the first time, the application of advanced geographic and temporal visualisation and statistical techniques are deployed to identify the spatial and temporal dynamics of malicious hoax calls and suspicious fires across Queensland.Aims of the researchThe aim of the research is to employ geographical statistical measures to identify hotspots and coldspots and map their evolution over time. Using the State Suburb as the spatial unit of analysis, the research is guided by three principal questions:1 .To what degree are malicious hoax calls and suspicious fires spatially concentrated in Queensland?2. How has the spatial concentration of events varied over time?3.To what extent are these spatial concentrations persistent, transient or emergent?DataFire incident dataQueensland fire incident data for a period of 13 years (1 January 1998 to 31 December 2010) were provided by the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service. The data include all calls for service under the categories of malicious hoax calls and suspicious fires.Malicious hoax calls are defined in the fire database as malicious or mischievous calls including alarm activations and manual call points. Suspicious fires are defined in the fire database as fires of incendiary nature where physical evidence indicates that the fire was deliberately set and no accidental or natural ignition factor could be found. …", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2911443697, 'How to induce resistance to the misinformation effect?

In a between-subject design, young healthy participants completed the initial phases of the misinformation experiment - they studied an event via a slideshow and then were exposed a related narrative that contained misleading information about that event. After, half of the participants were exposed to acute psychosocial stress and the other half completed a control task. Once stress levels returned to baseline, all of the participants completed the final phase of the experiment, which was a memory test for slideshow that included items containing true facts and misinformation. Participants in the stress condition showed a reduced misinformation effect and were better able to discriminate true from false information compared to control participants. This pattern of results held even when participants were tested on the same memory test after a multiple day delay, illustrating the long-lasting effects of stress on false memory formation specifically, and memory updating generally.

While Seeds are the ones who start spreading the rumor being adamantly convinced of its truth, Agnostics reject any kind of rumor and do not believe in conspiracy theories. In between, the Others constitute the main part of the community. While Seeds are always Believers and Agnostics are always Indifferents, Others can switch between being Believer and Indifferent depending on who they are discussing with. The underlying driving dynamics is implemented via local updates of randomly formed groups of agents. In each group, an Other turns into a Believer as soon as $m$ or more Believers are present in the group. However, since some Believers may lose interest in the rumor as time passes by, we add a flipping fixed rate $0<d<1$ from Believers into Indifferents. Rigorous analysis of the associated dynamics reveals that switching from $m=1$ to $m\\ge2$ triggers a drastic qualitative change in the spreading process.

Thus, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries various false “facts” concerning the soprano trombone have made the rounds. In concentrated form, they are to be found in Posaune, the eighth volume of Hans Kunitz’ series Die Instrumentation, first published in 1959 by Breitkopf & Hartel. Kunitz, however, did not content himself with a simple retelling of the usual legends, but added his own embellishments. In spite of the obvious source-historical problems in Kunitz’ book, other writers have apparently considered it to be credible, repeatedly employing it as a source for their own publications. More recently, additional works betraying Kunitz’ influence have appeared, including the article “Posaune” in the new MGG. Besides pricking the bubble of Kunitz’ hoax, I will also present early references and sources that may help us form a new, more accurate picture of the soprano trombone.

Using a structural model of demand that controls for the self-selected participation and allows for heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that these effects survive controls for point-of-purchase prices, purchase incidence, and the feedback effects of brand loyalty. We also find that the intervention increases the preference for the private label brands, and that it decreases the preference for the national brands, relative to the outside good.

(1) According to Pardes, certain essential aspects of the story of Israel would not have taken place were it not for the initiative and action of women. (2) The story of the Israelites could not have taken place without the single act of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Her eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil brings about culture (sewing), civilization (sexuality), and morality--three necessary components of society. (3) The Exodus from Egypt, for example, would not have taken place in the manner that it did were it not for the midwives, Shifra and Puah (Ex. 1:15), Moses\' mother and sister, and the daughter of Pharaoh who all played key roles in his survival. Let us not forget the somewhat bizarre decision of God to kill Moses, only for him to be saved by his wife Zipporah (Ex. 4:24-26). The purpose of this study is to contextualize the role of women as initiators through the story of Rebekah\'s deception of her husband Isaac. Before addressing the deception itself and its ramifications, it is important to have a clear picture of the relationship between Isaac and Rebekah and the relationship between the parents and their twin boys. Isaac met Rebekah after the death of his mother. It is not clear how much time passed between Sarah\'s death and Isaac taking Rebekah as his wife and bringing her into his mother\'s tent. This detail is important, but simply not available. In their first encounter, Rebekah falls off the camel when she sees Isaac. Certainly this gives a whole different meaning to the concept "falling in love." She immediately covers herself. The text does not supply us any more information. Thereafter, the text tells us vayeaveha [he loved her] (Gen. 24:67). The semantic field of the verb ahav encompasses various other possibilities, such as falling in love, making love, and loving. (4) This is the second occurrence of the verb in the Book of Genesis; the first time it appears, God calls upon Abraham to sacrifice his son, the one you love, Isaac (v. 22:2). Feldman raises the following question: Does the semantic field based on the first usage suggest that Isaac\'s love of Rebekah was more as a son to a mother than a husband to a wife? (5) This question becomes more acute especially in light of the fact that the text tells the reader the following: Isaac then brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebekah as his wife. Isaac loved her, and thus found comfort after his mother\'s death (v. 24:67). Therefore, it is important to be aware of the possible problematic foundation of the relationship between Isaac and Rebekah. Isaac\'s love of Rebekah is really a form of dependence. After they are married, the couple face a very difficult challenge--infertility. Isaac does not follow in the footsteps of his father to address the problem. Abraham, upon the suggestion of Sarah, takes Hagar as a concubine (v. 16:24). It is important to note that Jacob also follows Abraham\'s lead and when Rachel or Leah cannot conceive, he takes their servants as concubines (30:3; 30:9). Is it possible that the reason Isaac does not take a concubine is the trauma that he went through at the binding? This is possible, but in light of the Genesis 24:67 it is not probable. The reason for Isaac not taking a concubine has to do more with his relationship with Rebekah than any psychological trauma he may have suffered earlier in his life. Since the text tells the reader that Isaac loved Rebekah and establishes Rebekah\'s role as a comfort for Isaac, the reason Isaac did not seek a concubine appears to have been because of his dependant relationship on Rebekah. That is, Rebekah\'s comforting role in Isaac\'s life explains why he does not take another woman in order to produce a child. Rebekah conceives twin boys and one finds what Feldman calls "a neat distribution of loyalties."

We answer the first question by conducting: 1) a survival analysis shows that about 70% of claims will be fact-checked in one week and about 800 tweets with claim links are posted during this period, on average and 2) a cross-correlation analysis shows that the sharing of fact-checking articles typically lags that of misinformation by about one day.

For the operationalization and quantification of moral rhetoric in tweets, we use Extended Moral Foundations Dictionary in which five psychological dimensions (Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Purity/Sanctity) are considered. We show that people tend to share more tweets involving the virtue moral rhetoric than the tweets involving the vice rhetoric. We observe that the pattern of the moral rhetoric of tweets among these five dimensions are very similar during different time periods, while the strength of the five dimension is time-variant. Even though there is no significant difference between the use of Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty or Purity/Sanctity rhetoric, the less use of Harm/Care rhetoric is significant and remarkable.

We tested two classification approaches, namely probabilistic classification and linear classification on the title and the content, checking if it is clickbait/nonclickbait, respectively fake/real.

The Honest Ads Act will not reach organic social media posts, troll farms or -- most fundamentally -- the logic of social media sites which rewards outrage and bias confirmation. Moreover, it would not reach paid ads that are not considered "political", and there is a risk that an overly broad definition would raise First Amendment problems.

Literary hoaxes have taken many different appearances, and their ability to continue to evade early detection by publishing houses, readers and reviewers adds to their mischievousness and the intrigue surrounding them. Typically, hoax literature provides a compelling narrative that lures readers into valuing the words being read because they are supposed to be true. Consequently, once the hoax is revealed for what it is, readers often experience strong feelings of disappointment, anger and embarrassment for having been tricked; some are even amused for having been played the fool. Countless times, the book industry has been brought under fire for not catching a hoax before a book is released for public consumption and allowed to ravage unsuspecting readers.

We further describe the definition of fake news and discuss on different deception detection approaches presented in categories such as the content-based, social context-based and hybrid-based methods.

It is now clear that this event represented a decisive moment in U.S. relations with Latin America during the Cold War. Not surprisingly, given the significance of the event (a fact perceived at the time), a good number of studies have been dedicated to its analysis. Half a century later, and through the study of new records, the historiographic debate seems to have arrived at the conclusion that in the U.S. decision to overthrow Arbenz, the ideological imperatives and policies demanded by the global bipolar confrontation were more important than any economic motivation related to the influence of the banana monopoly, the United Fruit Company, on governing circles in Washington. (1) It is interesting that despite the abundant scholarly literature on the vast CIA operation to overthrow Arbenz via a military coup, (2) there are only scarce and dispersed references by those scholars to the exile of Arbenz. His exile has been treated as a painful personal drama. But on the contrary, the CIA documentation alerts us to how much the agency continued to dedicate itself covertly to destroying the public image of the president after he was toppled. Arbenz was considered a political figure of the first order of importance within the Latin American spectrum, a fact corroborated in the historiographic literature. For that reason the CIA seems to have taken an immediately vigilant attitude toward Arbenz. Based on the declassified documents consulted for this article, not only is it possible to determine the existence of a rigorous control and surveillance of each one of the former president\'s steps; also revealed is the extent to which the agency focused on targeted operations against the interests of Arbenz. Sometimes these were efforts to influence, and other times to orchestrate, some of the trials and tribulations, rumors, speculations, denunciations, and misinformation published by the media (especially Guatemalan and Uruguayan print media) about Arbenz, his family, his friends, and his political future. It is fitting to point out that this CIA media strategy, the central and specific topic of this article, was particularly intense between 1954 and 1960. With the eruption of the Cuban revolution Arbenz\'s notoriety entered a phase of some decline. After 1960 CIA records on Arbenz are scarce, and most probably, the efforts of the CIA were not necessary because by that time the ex-president was a symbol of defeat. (3) In any case, the proposal to investigate more deeply the surveillance and the attacks inspired by the CIA mainly during the first years of Arbenz\'s exile provides us the opportunity to understand a facet heretofore unknown of the CIA\'s methods. And no less important: the case reveals how opinion may be constructed. The Arbenz affair illuminates a strategy that the CIA valued positively. Indeed, one of its analysts commented, "[T]he language, the arguments and the techniques of the Arbenz episode" were "used in Cuba in the beginning of the decade of the 60s, in Brazil in 1964, in the Dominican Republic in 1965, and in Chile in 1973." (4) This significant affirmation confirms, as noted in much literature, that the 1954 "stainless" (5) triumph went far beyond the case of Guatemala. (6) As of this moment, the new materials permit us to establish three certain principles. First, one must point out that "the historian, in these years of Arbenz\'s life, cannot do otherwise than to simply narrate the facts" since he "completely disappeared from the history of his country" after his resignation. (7) Second, it is necessary to realize that we are beholding an event as painful as it has been silenced in Guatemalan history. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2923227117, 'Postmodernist sophistry, shoddy peer review, and academic dishonesty: How subjective science knowledge and patience for nonsense may cause (pseudo-)scholarly hoax.

INTRODUCTION: LAWS OF MISREPRESENTATION AND THE UNIQUE STATUS OF RADIO In explaining the limits of protection under the First Amendment, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote: "The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic."(1) This famous dictum has often been cited to underscore the fact that free speech will not be a viable defense when such speech is used to perpetrate a fraud or misrepresentation that is relied upon by others. When Holmes first scripted his observation in 1919, radio and the electronic mass media were still in their infancy. The next year would see the start of the very first broadcast radio station in the United States.(2) Few had heard of commercial radio broadcasts up to that point. The creation of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was still fourteen years away.(3) With the advent of commercial broadcasting, the challenges of balancing free speech with the interests of protecting the public from potentially harmful frauds raised to new levels. The theater in which one can shout "fire" is no longer confined to a single locale. The venue now ranges in size from individuals, to communities, to the entire global village. Since its inception, the FCC struggled in deciding where to draw the line regarding broadcast hoaxes. On the one hand, the FCC has sought to enforce regulations which ensure that the airwaves are used, among other reasons, "for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property."(4) On the other hand, the FCC has been reluctant to dictate the content of broadcasters, lest it stifle the vibrancy of the media in reaching its potential to fulfill artistic, informational, and cultural needs.(5) When it comes to perpetrating hoaxes, no medium other than the Internet has been as prolific as the radio. Not only is radio pervasive, it can have profound effects on its listeners. Author Tim Crook explained the primary reason why radio can have such a unique effect: [R]adio was the first electronic medium of mass entertainment and radio is a more psychological medium. Its relationship with its audience is based on an emotional and imaginative bond. In 1997[,] radio has not lost its importance as a huge and significant source for news and entertainment[,] and the opportunity to hoodwink the audience is as strong as it has ever been.(6) Certainly, the opportunity to mislead an audience exists in other mediums. Television and print media are equally capable of misleading consumers if the producers of their content are determined to do so. Additionally, the relatively unregulated Internet is fertile ground for various types of fraud and misinformation. However, certain limitations on other media technologies prevent them from having the same impact as radio. Print is not as immediate as radio. For instance, it is hard to imagine a newspaper displaying the headline, "Community Church Is Burning Now as Reader Is Reading this Paper." Whether the text is from newspapers or the Internet, it can only convey events that have taken place in the past or make predictions about the future. Television can have a more immediate impact, but viewing television requires an information consumer to be in a passive state. Few productive actions can be achieved simultaneously while watching television. One of the reasons radio remains an effective hoax medium is its unique ability to engage audiences while they are involved in different tasks. For instance, people can receive radio information while they are driving to work, washing dishes, typing, jogging, showering, or performing any number of tasks. In terms of portability, radio remains second only to newspapers in its ability to follow the audience throughout their daily lives. Visual media--such as print, television, and the Internet--require the undivided attention of a static viewer in order to receive information. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2967333199, 'The “Fake-News” Phenomenon and Transformation of Information Strategies in the Digital Society', 'A.

Members of the public are nevertheless frequently exposed to misinformation about climate change (and the degree of scientific consensus on climate change). One strategy to combat such misinformation is attitudinal “inoculation”—exposing individuals to a weakened item of misinformation along with a pre-emptive refutation. Van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Rosenthal, and Maibach (2017) reported that exposing participants to misinformation reduced the extent to which the participants perceived there to be a scientific consensus about climate change, but that the effect of this misinformation was successfully countered by an attitudinal inoculation. In this study, we report a preregistered replication of van der Linden et al. (2017). Our replication study used a mixed between-within design, with data collected via Mechanical Turk (N\xa0=\xa0792). We were able to replicate some (but not all) of van der Linden et al.’s findings. Specifically, we found that providing information about the scientific consensus on climate change increased perceptions of scientific consensus, as did an inoculation provided prior to provision of misinformation. However, we were unable to replicate their finding that an inoculation counteracted the effect of misinformation to a greater extent than simply providing information about scientific consensus—although this may have been due to a ceiling effect in our study.

Such attacks are typically carried out by querying the target model using inputs that are synthetically generated or sampled from a surrogate dataset to construct a labeled dataset. The adversary can use this labeled dataset to train a clone model, which achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the target model. We propose "Adaptive Misinformation" to defend against such model stealing attacks.

Given the complexity and time-consuming nature of combating disinformation through human assessment, one is motivated to explore harnessing AI solutions to automatically assess news articles for the presence of disinformation. A valuable first step towards automatic identification of disinformation is stance detection, where given a claim and a news article, the aim is to predict if the article agrees, disagrees, takes no position, or is unrelated to the claim. Existing approaches in literature have largely relied on hand-engineered features or shallow learned representations (e.g., word embeddings) to encode the claim-article pairs, which can limit the level of representational expressiveness needed to tackle the high complexity of disinformation identification. In this work, we explore the notion of harnessing large-scale deep bidirectional transformer language models for encoding claim-article pairs in an effort to construct state-of-the-art stance detection geared for identifying disinformation. Taking advantage of bidirectional cross-attention between claim-article pairs via pair encoding with self-attention, we construct a large-scale language model for stance detection by performing transfer learning on a RoBERTa deep bidirectional transformer language model, and were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance (weighted accuracy of 90.01%) on the Fake News Challenge Stage 1 (FNC-I) benchmark.

We use ‘disinformation’ to refer to motivated faking of news. We examine the effects that disinformation initiatives (many based on automated decision-making systems using Artificial Intelligence [AI] to cope with the scale of content being shared) have on freedom of expression, media pluralism and the exercise of democracy, from the wider lens of tackling illegal content online and concerns to request proactive (automated) measures of online intermediaries. We particularly focus on the responses of the member states and institutions of the European Union. In Section 1 , we argue that the apparent significance of the threat has led many governments to legislate despite this lack of evidence, with over 40 national laws to combat disinformation chronicled by March 2019. Which types of regulation are proposed, which actors are targeted, and who is making these regulations? Regulating fake news should not fall solely on national governments or supranational bodies like the European Union. Neither should the companies be responsible for regulating themselves. Instead, we favour co-regulation. Co-regulation means that the companies develop – individually or collectively – mechanisms to regulate their own users, which in turn must be approved by democratically legitimate state regulators or legislatures, who also monitor their effectiveness. In Section 2 , we explain the current EU use of Codes of Conduct. In Section 3 , we then explain the relatively novel idea that social media content regulation, and specifically disinformation, can be dealt with by deploying AI at massive scale. It is necessary to deal with this technological issue in order to explain the wider content of co-regulatory policy options, which we explain and for which we argue in Section 4 .

The article describes the initiative in Germany as linking up with the concept of Integrative Medicine which originated from the United States and today is spreading across the world. The DPM strives to assess divergent paradigms in medicine for their potential to complement each other.

In this context, reference is made to a position paper on medical professionalism signed by all DPM members which underlined that conventional and complementary medicine alike are obliged to adhere to scientific standards.

Patton ', 2003, 1, 'Abstract Lowar-division science students may have a naive view of science and a limited understanding of the role of argumentation in science. To make scientific arguments more visible, Patton designed a course, Frauds, Hoaxes and Pseudoscience, that required students to read "bad" scientific arguments, to critique those "bad" arguments, and to write their own "good" arguments. To assist students in their analysis of argumentation, Patton provided several models of argumentation and practical reasoning, including those of Stephen Toulmin and Chaim Perelman, which consider not only the reasons and evidence supporting a claim but also the warrants, backing, qualifiers, and reservations. Patton identifies antecedents for the course in classical and modern rhetoric, describes the course and its relevance to the modern college curriculum, and concludes that, while it is only one way of approaching argumentation, it might provide ideas for faculty in the humanities and social sciences as well as in the sciences. Introduction: Making disciplinary arguments visible While most undergraduates are challenged by the need to write good arguments, science students are especially challenged, particularly lower-division science students who may still think about science in terms of right/wrong, black/white, the-textbook-said-it-so-it\'s-true. Such dualistic thinkers may not yet understand that most of what we accept as scientific truth is the product of probabilistic, evidence-based arguments. Such dualistic thinkers may not yet understand that scientists typically narrow their claims to match the degree of probable truth permitted by the evidence and attending theories. For such thinkers, scientific arguments may be largely invisible. To make scientific arguments more visible and to offer several models for analyzing and producing arguments, I designed the course that will be described below, Frauds, Hoaxes, and Pseudoscience. I offered this course as a topics course in English, but I have since become aware of similar courses designed by philosophers, biologists, and physicists. Our common premise is that students better understand the elements of a sound argument if they are first exposed to some blatantly flawed arguments. By offering this course, I hoped to practice what I preach: to offer a writing-intensive course that promotes critical thinking through revision of written assignments, something that my colleagues and I advocate in our writing-in-the-disciplines workshops at the University of Missouri. I wanted to offer a course in argumentation that might appeal to majors outside of English, including science majors, as well as design a course that might provide sample argument-based assignments for science faculty at a loss for ideas. Although I had the unique needs of science faculty in mind, the idea behind Frauds, Hoaxes and Pseudoscience could be applied by social science and humanities faculty as well: first make disciplinary arguments visible (through bad examples), then critique them, and then improve upon them. Antecedents of the Course in Classical and Modern Rhetoric To clarify what I mean by "argument," I would like to distinguish the arguments of formal logic from those of informal logic. The arguments of formal logic, based on the syllogism, are absolute and unqualified, and are best suited to ideal, symbolic, or abstract disciplines, such as mathematics. The arguments of formal logic are usually ill-suited to complex, real-world problems, which are usually time- and situation-dependent. But just because "real-world" problems tend to be time- and situation-dependent does not mean that we must give up reasoning about them to find, if not the "correct" answer, the "best possible conclusion," given the available evidence. For real-world problems with uncertain premises, we need a system of informal logic. Today we witness the use of informal logic in the courtroom, in the senate, in grant reviews, and in virtually every aspect of policy making. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2913276738, 'Disinformation and digital influencing after terrorism: spoofing, truthing and social proofing', 'Martin Innes (Cardiff University), Diyana Dobreva (Cardiff University), Helen Innes (Cardiff University)', 2019, 1, 'This article explores how digital communications platforms are used in the aftermath of terrorist attacks to amplify or constrain the wider social impacts and consequences of politically motivated ...', 1338.0, 1, 0.0761904761904762, 2.22330830794537e-05), (2912201275, 'Leveraging Archival Theory to Develop A Taxonomy of Online Disinformation', 'Victoria Lemieux (University of British Columbia), Tyler D.

We conducted a literature review on the concept of misinformation, which showed that a more nuanced understanding of information and misinformation is needed. To understand and study different viewpoints when it comes to the perception of the accuracy of information, we introduce two new concepts: perceived misinformation and normative misinformation. The concepts are especially helpful when marginalised and vulnerable groups are studied, as these groups may perceive information differently compared to majority populations. Our literature review on the information practices of asylum seekers shows that asylum seekers come across different types of misinformation. These include official information that is inadequate or presented inadequately, outdated information, misinformation via gatekeepers and other mediators, information giving false hope or unrealistic expectations, rumours and distorted information. The diversity of misinformation in their lives shows that there is a need to understand information in general in a broad and more nuanced way. Based on this idea, we propose a Social Information Perception model (SIP), which shows that different social, cultural and historical aspects, as well as situation and context, are involved in the mental process which determines whether people perceive information as accurate information, misinformation or disinformation. The model, as well as the concepts of perceived and normative misinformation, are helpful when the information practices of marginalised and vulnerable groups are studied, giving a holistic view on their information situation.

We examine handwashing practices and beliefs about water temperature using a survey of 510 adults in the United States.

The decision to write this letter at this time is due to our desire to avoid any possibility of potential propagation of misinformation. Ironically, our review deals with controversies and pitfalls, and the reason for this letter is due to controversy as well. This controversy, which has been brewing for some time, is regarding the potential pitfall of confusing the neuroimaging findings of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with nonaccidental trauma.

In their letter, Hansen and Frikke accuse Fitzgerald and McClain of publishing the same case of HLH twice in two different journals and leaving out critical clinical information in one journal, resulting in two different interpretations of the findings [4, 5]. Dr. Leonidas’s letter confirms the dual submission accusation made by Hansen and Frikke, providing dates and proving that the two articles were submitted to two different journals within days of one another. Further, Dr. Leonidas confirms the accusation of Hansen and Frikke that the two articles did include at least one case of HLH with differing interpretations of the clinical findings [2]. In the article published in Pediatric Radiology by Fitzgerald and McClain, the authors describe the imaging findings of 25 children with HLH, including bone and brain involvement [4]. The bony findings, described as periosteal reaction, cortical irregularity, osteopenia and rib fractures, were not stated to be due to HLH, but their cause was not made clear. Regarding the brain findings, one of the cases included in the Fitzgerald-McClain article was also included in an article by Rooms, Fitzgerald and McClain in Pediatrics entitled “Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis masquerading as child abuse: presentation of three cases and review of central nervous system findings in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis” [5].

This takes the form of a democratic facade that promises much but delivers little, leaving its citizens confronted by what Raymond Williams described as ‘the coexistence of political representation and participation with an economic system which admits no such rights, procedures or claims’.\xa0 The media themselves are partly to blame: their attachments to power and their use of sensationalism and soundbites ‘degrade the quality of political discussion and reduce the competence of citizens’. This sham sovereignty is not incidental to, but intertwined with, the liberal capitalism of which our mainstream media industries are very much a part. The real problem isn’t the Macedonian cottage industry churning out pro-Trump messages, but the fact that in equating liberal democracy (and a liberal media) with meaningful control of our collective lives, we have been swindled. Actually existing democracy (rather than its utopian ideal) – both in its rhetoric and its political routines – has very successfully used discourses of equality and autonomy to commodify individualism and constrain freedom. And in doing so, it has given us nothing more than the illusion of democratic communications: a media where editors and top politicians dine at the same tables, are educated at the same institutions, and share many of the same corporate values and ideological agendas; a media that is disaggregated in theory but centralized in practice; a media where the tools may be open source but where the most powerful networks remain closed. This is a media marked by commerce, complicity, and caution rather than critique, creativity, and a journalism of conscience. Media institutions are massively implicated in fake democracy as both subject and object of a socio-economic restructuring that favours the upward transfer and concentration of property and wealth. Mainstream media outlets have failed to use their symbolic power to challenge this shift to offer alternative visions and truly representative narratives, serving up instead an anaemic diet of stories that are frequently shallow, decontextualised, misleading, or downright biased – for example the economics journalism that assumes the ‘expertise’ of financial commentators and the legitimacy of austerity policies,the reporting of ‘terror’ that marginalizes geopolitical tensions and inequalities, the negative coverage of progressive movements and leaders, and the popular representations of welfare claimants as ‘revolting subjects’ that seek to mobilize a sense of disgust towards the ‘unproductive’ and ‘undeserving poor’ in the contemporary world.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3014502510, 'Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: filtering fact from fiction in the infodemic: Q&A with virologist Professor Urs Greber.', 'Daniela Ruffell (Heidelberg University)', 2020, 1, ': As the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the world, and the associated lung disease COVID-19 remains difficult to treat, information from media and private communication flows at high speed, often through unfiltered channels.

Here we track large databases of fake news and real news in both, Weibo in China and Twitter in Japan from different cultures, which include their traces of re-postings. We find in both online social networks that fake news spreads distinctively from real news even at early stages of propagation, e.g. five hours after the first re-postings.

One important challenge we face is to efficiently and effectively use recently gathered data and find computational tools to combat the COVID-19 infodemic, a typical information overloading problem. Novel coronavirus presents many questions without ready answers; its uncertainty and our eagerness in search of solutions offer a fertile environment for infodemic. It is thus necessary to combat the infodemic and make a concerted effort to confront COVID-19 and mitigate its negative impact in all walks of life when saving lives and maintaining normal orders during trying times. In this position paper of combating the COVID-19 infodemic, we illustrate its need by providing real-world examples of rampant conspiracy theories, misinformation, and various types of scams that take advantage of human kindness, fear, and ignorance. We present three key challenges in this fight against the COVID-19 infodemic where researchers and practitioners instinctively want to contribute and help. We demonstrate that these three challenges can and will be effectively addressed by collective wisdom, crowdsourcing, and collaborative research.', 757.9747187023501, 1, 0.111111111111111, 2.1991575266711603e-05), (2114662906, 'Eyewitness testimony in civil litigation: retention, suggestion, and misinformation in product identification.', 'Jonathan Trent Terrell ', 2008, 1, 'Although expert testimony regarding eyewitness memory is now common in criminal trials, eyewitness testimony is also critical in civil litigation. This is particularly true in product liability cases involving alleged exposure to toxic substances like asbestos. Witnesses in these cases must recall specific brands of products that may have been used decades earlier. The present experiments investigated eyewitness memory for brand names of various kitchen products seen in a cooking show. Although memory was reasonably accurate at brief delays, within a week recognition rates for the brand names dropped to scarcely above chance; nearly half of these delayed selections were of the most familiar (but unseen) brands. Subtle and inaccurate post-event suggestions produced robust false alarm rates--nearly 70% of responses when the most popular brands were suggested. Additionally, confidence in the accuracy of responses and actual accuracy was inversely related following the introduction of misinformation. ********** During a recent asbestos liability trial (Hampel, 2005), the 55-year-old daughter of a mesothelioma victim testified that she remembered the brand of joint compound her father had used during a distant project, and was able to describe its container confidently, and in some detail. When a defense attorney asked her if she recalled the type of paint her father had used on the same project, she replied with an incredulous "No," and then added, "It was 35 years ago." That the capability to recall a brand of paint from 35 years ago should not differ from the capability to recall a brand of joint compound used 35 years ago seems to have escaped this witness--a notion that may often be unappreciated by jury members as well. Here we intend to explore some of the factors influencing the reliability of eyewitness memory for product information. An increasing awareness of memory\'s reconstructive nature has prompted a thorough reevaluation of the usefulness of eyewitness memory testimony in the criminal courtroom (Wells & Loftus, 2003). The Department of Justice has created a thorough series of guidelines for the handling of eyewitness evidence in criminal cases (see U. S. Department of Justice, 1999), and memory experts are commonly called upon to make clear to jurors in such cases that "memory is not a video tape." April 23, 2007 marked the 200th criminal conviction exonerated by DNA evidence in the United States of America. According to www.innocenceproject.org, over 75% of the 200 criminal cases shown to be wrongful convictions in the United States involved faulty eyewitness testimony. Collectively, these 200 people spent a total of 2,475 years in prison. Only three years ago, Loftus (2004) provided an interesting summary of this growing problem and how it happened on the heels of the 100th DNA exoneration. One of the most common paradigms used to study eyewitness memory involves the introduction of false information to a witness after an event happens. Frequently, this post-event misinformation becomes integrated into the witness\' memory of the event, a phenomenon known as the "misinformation effect" (Loftus, Donders, Hoffman, & Schooler, 1989). For example, an eyewitness may view a traffic scene involving a yield sign. Later, if an investigator asks a question about a stop sign, the witness may integrate this assertion into her or his memories (Loftus, Miller, & Burns, 1978). Loftus et al. (1989) contend that misinformation effects result from the outright eradication of the previous memory trace by the new suggestion, while others (see Chandler, Gargano, & Holt, 2001) argue that both the suggestion and the original event coexist in memory, but are confused at the time of retrieval. The resulting inaccurate recollections are regarded as source confusion errors. Regardless of their cause, misinformation effects are robust and highly replicable, and have cemented the notion that eyewitness memory is highly malleable. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2410128705, 'Nevirapine misinformation: will it kill?', 'John S James ', 2004, 1, ': In mid December 2004 three Associated Press stories created widespread doubts about nevirapine, a well-known, critically important drug that can prevent HIV in many of the 1,800 babies now infected every day by their mothers in childbirth.

Video footage from the airports revealed that at least three South Africans boarded each fatal plane. The subject is still under investigation, but sources believe that it has a strong link to the recent US boikot (sic) of the racism conference held in the South African city of Durban. CNN information sources disclose (sic) that some of the masterminds might be in hideaway in South Africa. Strong links has (sic) also been made between SA and Lybia (sic).\' It was reported by the South African (SA) newspaper media that this e-mail had significant national, international, and financial repercussions and influenced relations between the United States (US) and the SA governments at a difficult time in the history of the US. It reportedly resulted in the decline of the SA currency and had a negative effect on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ("Bolandse broers", 2001; Coetzee, 2001; Damon, 2001a; Momberg, 2001). The Conradie brothers, allegedly responsible for the creation and dissemination of the e-mail, were charged with sabotage and fraud, but eventually all charges against them were dropped. In this paper the details of the incident are presented in the form of a case study as reported by various SA newspapers, in particular Beeld, Burger, Business Day, Cape Argus, Cape Times, Citizen, Pretoria News, Rapport, Sowetan, and Star. In (Barnard, De Ridder & Pretorius, 2001) we argued for the use of case studies in teaching computer ethics. Case studies present instructors with a powerful pedagogical method to, apart from sensitizing students to ethical and social concerns of computing, contribute to the development of critical reasoning and analytical skills (Gotterbarn & Riser, 1997). Furthermore, we agree with Spinello (2003, p. xiii) that \'the case study remains a popular instrument to provoke students to grapple with complicated moral problems and quandaries. Cases present such problems in a particular context ...\' The hoax e-mail case study that took place in a SA context is presented in this paper together with a discussion thereof, and we contend that this multifaceted case study can be put to good use by computing instructors in the teaching of computer ethics issues, such as the power of the Internet, ethical issues of Internet conduct, law and security, to their students. The case study is presented in the form of a timeline of the newspaper coverage in order to convey the unfolding of the sequence of events. This presentation consists of three sections. Firstly we present the factual contents of the newspaper reports and secondly we identify the various stakeholders.

Subsequently we analyze the case study from various perspectives. We take a closer look at the reported perceptions of the different stakeholders and we consider various aspects of appropriate ethical analyses. We also briefly investigate why the ethical and legal perspectives and conclusions turned out to be in conflict and finally conclude with a short discussion of some recent initiatives regarding computer ethics in SA.

Via social media platforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and put users and communities at great risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain fresh and high-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning models for fake news detection. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a reinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND, which can leverage users' reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of training data for fake news detection. The proposed framework consists of three main components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news detector. The annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news based on users' reports. The reinforced selector using reinforcement learning techniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and filters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector's prediction performance. The fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the news content.

These individuals are affecting public understanding of the issue. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Scientific journalism vs scientific discovery Journalism exists in many forms--eg, advocacy, scientific, investigative--and has led to positive and negative social and cultural changes. Scientific journalism interprets information to make it interesting and understandable to readers. Ideally, journalists select what is newsworthy and provide balance to disputed themes with careful attention to the facts. Sometimes, a scientific journalist may render his or her opinion on the topic, explicitly or implicitly. When this occurs, the journalist may reflect the state-of-the-art accurately, or he or she may present biased journalism. Although the modus operandi of a journalist can differ significantly from that of an expert conducting scientific inquiry, I do not intend to render a judgment about the superiority or inferiority of either group. Both groups have the ability to impact discovery, negatively and positively. Scientific experts acquire and report scientific evidence regarding depression. Additionally, they develop professional guidelines to provide practical advice to clinicians who wrestle with the challenges of treating depression. Journalists are not trained to render medical judgments about the data; they simply report it. Experts rely on pure transparency from the initial hypothesis through the design, methods, results, and conclusions. In contrast, journalists enjoy the time-honored privilege of hiding sources\' identities. Before a scientific expert\'s paper is published, he or she must negotiate a peer review process in which his or her writing is subjected to the scrutiny of qualified experts in the same field, a process that can last months to years. Journalistic methodologies also include editorial oversight, but it\'s fair to say that the peer review process for scientific publication generally is more rigorous than editorial reviews of journalism, because the journalistic review process serves the goal of generating "news" for a hungry marketplace of ideas. Journalists pick and chose their content, hopefully in a balanced fashion, but at the discretion of the journalist and his or her editor. It\'s relatively quick and easy for journalists to publish a book or newspaper article, and even easier to publish a blog. Experts submitting manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals are not paid based on sales or impact factor. The literary style of the expert often is dry and technical compared with journalistic style. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3005258819, 'Approaching Fake News at the Expense of Truth: A Psychophysiological Study of News on Social Media.', 'Lauren Kirkwood , Randall Minas (University of Hawaii at Manoa)', 2020, 1, '', 0.0, 1, 0.0, 2.16932469467349e-05), (3034254906, 'GCAN: Graph-aware Co-Attention Networks for Explainable Fake News Detection on Social Media', 'Yi-Ju Lu , Cheng-Te Li (National Cheng Kung University)', 2020, 1, 'This paper solves the fake news detection problem under a more realistic scenario on social media.

This paper addresses several problems with the proposed legislation that are likely to do violence to women's right to non-coercive and respectful health care. The first problem is that the proposal demonstrates ignorance about what women need and want in order to make a decision about abortion. The proposal also reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of counselling, notably the misrepresentation of counselling as 'advice giving'. Counselling in Australia is an unregulated profession and as a result anti-abortion groups are free to exploit the term 'counselling', and therefore women, to benefit their own personal/moral/religious and/or political agendas. This paper argues that the proposed legislation's stated aim of reducing the abortion rate directly contradicts any notion of 'independent' counselling. If such legislation were enacted, a further form of violence against women (the violence of misinformation) would be manifested, with negative outcomes for women and for the reputation and accountability of the counselling profession. Currently in Australia a woman's right to abortion, and the context within which she is able to access one, are once again on the public and political agenda. Among other strategies, proponents of the anti-choice position are suggesting that women must undergo compulsory counselling before being able to access abortion. The suggestion is being made as part of a strategy to reduce the number of abortions in Australia. Some people who hold positions of power in Australia use their status to voice their opinions on the subject of abortion based on personal or moral ideologies, with the aim of influencing public opinion. These antichoice ideas are voiced and often debated but do not occur within a context that recognises the plethora of scientific evidence about abortion, the nature and purpose of counselling, or what Australian women are saying they need regarding their reproductive health care. This paper explores unintended pregnancy and counselling. It shows the importance of establishing what women actually want, and challenges the notion of counselling as an appropriate vehicle for reducing the numbers of abortion.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2155445238, "Perceptions of Anti-Terrorism among Students at China's Guangzhou University: Misinformation or Misinterpretation?", 'Simon Shen (The Chinese University of Hong Kong), Peng Liu (Renmin University of China)', 2009, 1, 'Abstract By conducting a set of quantitative surveys, this study evaluates the perception of Chinese students on terrorism.

This has abated trust in the media, leaving readers in a state of perplexity. There exists an enormous assemblage of research on the theme of Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for fake news detection. In the past, much of the focus has been given on classifying online reviews and freely accessible online social networking-based posts. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (FNDNet) for fake news detection. Instead of relying on hand-crafted features, our model (FNDNet) is designed to automatically learn the discriminatory features for fake news classification through multiple hidden layers built in the deep neural network. We create a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract several features at each layer. We compare the performance of the proposed approach with several baseline models. Benchmarked datasets were used to train and test the model, and the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of 98.36% on the test data. Various performance evaluation parameters such as Wilcoxon, false positive, true negative, precision, recall, F1, and accuracy, etc. were used to validate the results. These results demonstrate significant improvements in the area of fake news detection as compared to existing state-of-the-art results and affirm the potential of our approach for classifying fake news on social media.

David Mech (United States Geological Survey)', 2012, 1, 'After reading the Policy Forum “Rescuing wolves from politics: Wildlife as a public trust resource” (J. T. Bruskotter et al. , 30 September 2011, p. [1828][1]), I would like to set the record straight. First, state governments have not shown “hostility toward wolves.” Rather, each state wolf-management plan was vetted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and each seeks to maintain wolf numbers at or above 150% of official recovery levels. Second, although there always will be disagreement about what constitutes recovery of any imperiled species, teams of highly qualified scientists set wolf recovery criteria, and in the West, wolf numbers exceeded those goals by 500 to 600% before delisting. Third, although public opinion toward wolves is variable ([ 1 ][2]), state wolf-management regulations are totally different now than when wolves were deliberately exterminated ([ 2 ][3], [ 3 ][4]). State wolf management will be monitored by the USFWS, and the wolf can be relisted anytime if necessary; strict post-delisting monitoring plans are in place for this.\n\nThus, the gist of the Policy Forum—that “courts must use the [Public Trust] doctrine to hold states accountable to their trust obligations” is redundant. The states, through their science-based wolf management plans, are already adhering to their public trust obligations as required by state laws for all wildlife species.\n\nBecause wolves and wolf management are contentious, no government entity can fully satisfy all viewpoints. Thus, agencies compromise by setting regulations that ensure the conservation and survival of their populations while still attempting to assert some population control. Citizens assert their control over state actions through lobbying, elections, referenda, and other legal means ([ 4 ][5]), and that approach is well in place.\n\n1. [↵][6] 1. J. T. Bruskotter, 2. E.

Individuals with social anxiety usually pay attention to threatening social information during and after social events and they often feel anxious due to remaining memories of their “poor” performance. Information-processing models of emotional disorders suggest that preferential processing of threat-relevant information such as a memory bias for threat-relevant information underlie this disorder. Cognitive models also believe that socially anxious people are characterized by biases in the recall of social events and these biases may play a causal role in the development and maintenance of social anxiety disorders. However, the findings of the previous studies are mixed and further research is needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the implicit and explicit memory bias against negative emotional information processing in students with and without social anxiety disorder. The study includes two groups: students with social anxiety disorder (N= 25, Mean age = 22.21; SD = 2.97) and the control group (N = 25, Mean age = 21.83; SD = 2.25). Socially anxious students were selected based on their results on a clinical interview and Connor's Social Phobia Inventory. The groups were matched in terms of variables including age, sex, and education level. The implicit memory test was a word recognition task and the explicit memory test was an incidental free recall with threatening and neutral words. The social anxious group presented an overall higher priming effect in the implicit memory test and recalled more anxious relevant words than other word types. However, no significant difference was found between students with and without social anxiety disorder in explicit memory. The results indicated the presence of implicit memory bias in students with social anxiety disorder. Biases in implicit memory can be proposed as possible mechanisms to explain why people with social anxiety tend to make negative evaluations of themselves in social situations. In fact, biased processing after the social event may play an important role in facilitating the selective recall of negative information about one's social performance, so that it affects their future performance in social situations. Generally, the results of the present research are in accord with other researches and support the principles governing memory bias and social anxiety disorder according to cognitive theories of social anxiety.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2543570631, 'Effectiveness of pharmacogenetic information in the treatment of major depressive disorder: results from the AB-GEN randomized clinical trial', 'V.

Gaughan (Drake University)', 2017, 1, 'The 2016 presidential election shook American democracy to its foundations. From Russia’s hacking of Democratic National Committee emails to President Trump’s false allegations of widespread voting fraud, America’s democratic institutions emerged from the election battered and bruised. The stunning turn of events and the unprecedented controversy that surrounded the election had a profound impact on public opinion. National surveys now consistently find that a majority of Americans question the integrity of the nation’s election system. Accordingly, this article contends that we have entered into a dangerous new chapter in the nation’s history that not only threatens public confidence in election fairness but potentially could even undermine the long-term health of the nation’s democracy. The unjustified fear of election fraud has itself become a threat to America’s democratic principles. \r\nThis article identifies three toxic developments that if left unchecked threaten the future of voting rights in America. The first is the rise of fake news. As the traditional news media has lost its gate-keeper status and as the internet has facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation, false allegations of voting fraud dominate news cycles. The pervasive nature of the claims has triggered a precipitous decline in public confidence in election integrity, even though there is no factual basis to justify the public’s fear of widespread fraud. The second is the phenomenon of hyperpolarization. The partisan divide has reached such historic levels that Republicans and Democrats increasingly view the opposing party as a threat to the nation’s well-being. Hyperpolarization makes partisans more inclined to attempt to limit the political influence of opposing voters, a development that is particularly dangerous in the United States because of the third toxic feature of contemporary politics: partisan control of election administration. Unusual among major democracies, the United States entrusts the majority party with responsibility for administering elections and setting voting rules. In recent years partisans have become increasingly aggressive in adopting election laws that benefit one party at the expense of the other. The real scandal of American politics is not illegal vote rigging or voter fraud but rather the extent to which partisans are legally permitted to manipulate election rules for political advantage. \r\nThe United States thus stands at a uniquely dangerous moment in its history. The risk that America may evolve into an illiberal democracy is particularly high in light of the ongoing battle over voter registration restrictions and other laws that limit access to voting. In the name of safeguarding election integrity, legislatures across the country have adopted new voting laws that many courts and scholars have concluded make it harder for poor and minority voters to participate in the democratic process. As Americans increasingly view election stakes in apocalyptic terms, as false allegations of election fraud spread like wildfire, and as partisan officials control election rules, America’s democratic institutions face their most serious domestic challenge since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.

Although effect sizes were modest (0.22 to 0.38 forgrowth hormone alone and 0.61 for growth hormone and testoster-one), these ﬁndings suggest a previously unreported physiologic ef-fect that has potential implications for athletic performance.

Past research has demonstrated that the right to left transfer is faster in typically developing individuals compared to a left to right transfer. Numerous studies have found that the corpus callosum is structurally smaller and atypical in individuals with Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) but whether this is associated with changes in interhemispheric time transfer in adult individuals with ASD is relatively unknown. Method The current study used a Poffenberger paradigm in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) to measure IHTT between individuals with ASD and typically developing controls. The IHTT in each direction was estimated by comparing the latencies of P100 and N170 components in hemispheres contralateral and ipsilateral to lateralised visual stimulation. Results Both groups demonstrated faster right to left transfer of information compared to the left to right transmission. Individuals with ASD exhibited faster IHTT latencies overall for the P100 and N170 components compared to matched typically developing controls. More importantly, these results demonstrate that the ASD group exhibited faster transfer in both directions compared to matched typically developing controls.

While choice deficits represent a core component of addictive behavior, possibly consecutive to brain changes preceding the onset of the addiction cycle, the evidence on grey-matter and white-matter damage underlying abnormal choices in AUD is still limited. To fill this gap, we assessed the neurostructural bases of decision-making performance in 22 early-abstinent alcoholic patients and 18 controls, by coupling the Cambridge Gambling Task\xa0(CGT) with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging metrics of grey-matter density and white-matter integrity. Regardless of group, voxel based morphometry highlighted an inverse relationship between deliberation time and grey-matter density, with alcoholics displaying slower choices related to grey-matter atrophy in key nodes of the motor control network. In particular, grey-matter density in the supplementary motor area, reduced in alcoholic patients, explained a significant amount of variability in their increased deliberation time. Tract-based spatial statistics revealed a significant relationship between\xa0CGT deliberation time and all white-matter indices, involving the most relevant commissural, projection and associative tracts. The lack of choice impairments other than increased deliberation time highlights reduced processing speed, mediated both by grey-matter and white-matter alterations, as a possible marker of a generalized executive impairment extending to the output stages of decision-making.

Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display deficits in the sleep-associated consolidation of declarative memory, possibly due to an altered function of SO. The present study aimed at enhancing SO activity using closed-looped acoustic stimulation during slow-wave sleep in children with ADHD. METHODS A total of 29 male children (14 with ADHD; aged 8-12 years) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study trial. Children spent two experimental nights in a sleep lab, one stimulation night and one sham night. A declarative learning task (word-pair learning) with a reward condition was used as a primary outcome. Secondary outcome variables were a procedural memory (serial reaction time) and working memory (WM; n-back) task. Encoding of declarative and procedural memory took place in the evening before sleep. After sleep, the retrieval took place followed by the n-back task. RESULTS The stimulation successfully induced SO activity during sleep in children with and without ADHD. After stimulation, only healthy children performed better on high-rewarded memory items (primary outcome). In contrast, there were indications that only children with ADHD benefitted from the stimulation with respect to procedural as well as WM performance (secondary outcome). CONCLUSIONS We were able to show that the acoustic closed-loop stimulation can be applied to enhance SO activity in children with and without ADHD.

Audience availability can be structured to avoid privacy concerns, and it meets an important speech value in the “marketplace of ideas” theory of the First Amendment—that of enabling counter speech. Our proposed regulations would capture any political advertising, including disinformation, that is promoted via paid distribution on social media, as well as all other online political advertising. Second, existing loopholes in transparency regulations related to online advertising should be closed.

This makes WWW searching the first method to find information for a growing number of users. A review of the state of the art is given by Manning, Raghavan, & Schutze, 2008. On the other hand, many users are still frustrated by: * scarcity of information that is available through the WWW, in the case of many specific information needs and * low precision of WWW search results. This author experiences this also more formally in years of guiding and teaching students in universities and scientific workshops. Searching for Images on the WWW WWW image search systems are of course mainly suitable to find relevant images on the WWW. It may be somewhat confusing that these systems do not search for images in some magical or real way, but that they are in fact text search engines that do not show texts with links as results but text search engines that yield thumbnail images with links to the original document on the WWW. Moreover, image searching can also be used to find relevant documents by first selecting relevant images and by subsequent linking to the complete document. An advantage in comparison with more common text search engines is that in many cases images can be screened and selected faster than texts; we can summarize this as \'seeing is faster than reading\'. For the past few years, the big companies that offer the most popular WWW search engines are Google, Microsoft (MSN, Live, Bing ...) and Yahoo! All these offer also more dedicated image search engines (JISC, 2008). Misinformation besides Information on the WWW Content on the Internet is a mixture of: * sound, valuable, neutral, scientific information that is offered in many cases by educational and non-profit organizations, * information that is biased, often by commercial interests, * useless documents without informative value, * even "disinformation" or "misinformation". The presence of lower quality information makes it difficult and challenging for retrieval systems to provide high quality search results and for the user to find relevant information. This is important and has been investigated mainly in medicine (see the review by Eysenbach, Powell, Kuss, & Sa, 2002, and the more recent investigation by Ostry, Young, & Hughes, 2007). The author of this paper focuses on a different subject domain, namely art and more specifically classical African sculptural art. In recent years while screening all kinds of documents related to African art, such as WWW pages, logos, brochures and even articles and books, I have observed that many show objects as "African art", whereas people familiar with this field see on the photos objects of an embarrassingly low quality, objects that are based on or copied from real, old, classical, high quality, authentic African art. The authors are often students, but also others who may be well placed to create a logo or write a book, but who have clearly not much expertise in the area of African art. More specifically, I have observed in more than one such case the photos had simply been copied from the WWW, probably because this is convenient, fast and easy. All this indicates that: * finding appropriate images is still not straightforward * besides information, also misinformation is distributed through the WWW * information users can be misinformed by the content of WWW pages * misinformed users become new sources of more misinformation. The word "misinformation" is perhaps an exaggeration in this context, but it is clear that the problem is here and will probably not be eliminated completely. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (296864197, 'Lack of time for communication creating "cycles of misinformation" about use of antibiotics.', 'H Kent ', 1999, 1, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2052716803, 'The Efficacy of Information-giving in Cognitive-behavioural Treatment for Panic Disorder', 'Clare S Rees , Jeffrey C Richards , Leigh M Smith ', 1999, 1, 'Despite its inclusion as a basic component of the cognitive-behavioural treatment for panic disorder, the effects of the provision of information about panic anxiety have not been separately assessed.

METHOD First-page search results of three search engines (with search term "anorexia nervosa") were consulted. Websites were excluded if they were pro-ana, duplications, advertisements, Wikipedia, nonwritten/video, invalid addresses, non-English, book links, articles/news pages, and discussion forums. Fifteen websites were evaluated on information quality using DISCERN, and on readability using the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) Scale. Spearman\'s correlations between quality and readability were calculated. RESULTS DISCERN-scores ranged from 34 to 71 (M = 49.27, SD = 9.16), representing "fair" information quality. FRE-scores ranged from 28 to 64 (M = 42.7, SD = 13.43), representing "difficult" readability. The Royal College of Psychiatrists website (https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/) received the only "excellent" quality rating and was the only website that met the recommended reading level. The other websites\' quality varied, and their reading levels ranged from fairly to very difficult. CONCLUSION Website quality scores varied. Oftentimes, information about treatment risks and benefits was lacking, and texts were too complex. Website quality seals could prove beneficial, and web developers should use quality and readability measures to ensure information accessibility. Future research should utilize DISCERN and FRE to evaluate quality and readability of websites pertaining to other eating disorders too.

It is fairly common for women to use the Internet in order to find information about various weight-loss methods, but it was further questioned whether perfectionism and eating disorder symptomatology could be linked to this behavior. Materials and Methods: Participants were 228 women (Mean age = 30.5; SD = 9.43) recruited via social media, who provided responses on measures of perfectionism, eating disorder symptoms, and a short check-list measuring the frequency of online searching about five topics (food, diet, exercise, body appearance, and eating disorders). Results: Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that the BMI and Discrepancy subscale of APS-R significantly predicted online searching, along with eating disorder symptomatology. Moreover, mediation analyses resulted in a significant indirect effect, but not a direct effect, indicating that eating disorder symptomatology fully mediated the relationship between BMI and online searching, as well as between maladaptive perfectionism and online searching. Conclusion: These findings shed light on a high BMI and maladaptive perfectionism as potential risk factors for eating disorder-related behavior on the Internet.

The way in which Google operates as a company and generates revenue is often sidelined in academic discussions regarding the cultural implications of how its search engine functions. Almost 90% of Google’s revenue is derived from advertising, despite Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s original academic paper regarding Google in which they argue that advertising produces mixed motives that make it an unfeasible way to fund search engines. This article outlines how Google’s model of advertising reflects and encourages wider changes in capitalism as it shifts from its twentieth-century Fordist incarnation to contemporary Post-Fordist arrangements of labour. In doing so, this article analyses Google’s two main advertising systems, AdWords and AdSense, and proposes that these financial models have significant effects upon online discourse. In discussing AdWords, this article details some of the tensions between the local and the global that develop when tracing flows of information and capital, specifically highlighting Google’s impact on the decline of online language diversity. In outlining AdSense, this article demonstrates how Google’s hegemonic control prescribes which parts of the web can be monetised and which remain unprofitable. In particular, in drawing from existing studies, evidence is provided that Google’s AdSense programme, along with Google’s relationship with Facebook, incentivised the rise of fake news in the 2016 US presidential election.

The cost is expressed in terms of the quality of information received as well as the infection cost. The problem is formulated as a mean-field game with multiclass agents which is suitable to model a massive heterogeneous IoBT system. For this game, the mean-field equilibrium is characterized, and an algorithm based on the forward backward sweep method is proposed to find the mean-field equilibrium. Then, the finite IoBT case is considered, and the conditions of convergence of the Nash equilibria in the finite case to the mean-field equilibrium are presented.

To experimentally test enhanced memory retrieval of negative social information, using a newly developed variant of a looking-at-nothing paradigm, 45 BPD patients and 36 healthy women learned positive and negative personality traits of different target persons. In a translational memory test, participants were asked to use the learned information to evaluate statements about the target person. In addition to behavioral measures of memory performance, we investigated eye gaze patterns to decompose memory retrieval processes. We hypothesized that BPD patients would retrieve negative as compared to positive person information more accurately than healthy controls, and show increased eye gaze toward spatial locations where negative information was provided during the learning phase. Results pointed to a more accurate retrieval of negative person attributes in the patient group as compared with healthy controls, thereby corroborating a negativity bias in social cognition in an exemplary sample of patients with interpersonal problems. Interestingly, the observed negativity bias for person memory was associated with BPD severity, stronger expectancies to be rejected by others, and social detachment. No group differences regarding eye fixation behavior were found. We propose that enhanced retrieval of negative person information might be associated with dysfunctional cognitive schemas as well as reduced behavioral trust, and be of relevance for mental disorders characterized by interpersonal difficulties.

Based on genetic-epigenetic and chronobiological factors a hyperintentional personality structure, if faced with non-feasible intentional programs in the environment, suffers from inner and outer stress. This stress situation leads to imbalances in information processing in glial-neuronal synaptic units, called tripartite synapses. In depression the overexpression of astrocytic receptors and of gap junctions in the astroglial network causes a prolonged information processing which affects the behavior generating systems in the brainstem reticular formation. Because the activation of the behavior generating systems is protracted, they are unable to select an appropriate mode of behavior (e.g. communicating, eating, working, sleeping, etc.) from sensory information in real time. Inversely, in mania astrocytic receptors and gap junctions are underexpressed causing a shortened synaptic information processing with rapid changes in behavior.

In this regard, after witnessing an event, there are numerous factors that can cause memories to be inaccurate when a person tries to recall an event. For example, when a police officer asks an eyewitness to recall a crime, if the police officer’s questions contain new information that was not actually a part of the actual crime, this new information can alter the eyewitness’ memory of the crime (Belli & Loftus, 1996). This is often referred to as the ‘misinformation effect’ (Loftus & Hoffman, 1989). The misinformation effect can occur in other ways as well. In a seminal study conducted by Loftus and Palmer (1974), research participants watched a filmed traffic accident, and then they were asked, ‘About how fast were the cars going when they ______ (smashed into, hit, or contacted) each other?’ The participants’ responses were influenced by whatever verb was used in the question. When ‘smashed into’ was used in the question, this led participants to rate the speed in miles per hour higher than when the other verbs were used in the questions. Research has indicated that if an object such as a knife is mentioned during questioning about an incident, it will often be remembered as having been a part of the actual incident even though it was not present (Dodson & Reisberg, 1991). Other research examining the misinformation effect indicates that hearing new information about an event can make it more of a challenge for people when they are trying to retrieve the original memory (Tversksy & Tuchin, 1989). There are also occasions when new information gets integrated in to an old memory, and the new information and the old memory become so intertwined that they become virtually impossible to untangle (Loftus, 1992). When explaining the misinformation effect to students, it has been our experience that students often find this research difficult to believe. Students have a hard time understanding how memories are not exact, video recording-like representations of an event. Additionally, it has been our experience that when students are asked if their own memories would be subject to the misinformation effect, students often respond that they do not fall victim to the misinformation effect.

Defending claims. Making arguments. Although these words might conjure images of a courtroom, we\'re referring to today\'s classroom. Drawing upon evidence has become a central focus of recent curricular reforms across all subject areas. For example, the Common Core State Standards English language arts document, which includes literacy standards for history/social studies and other subjects, uses the word "evidence" 135 times. But what is evidence? Is all evidence created equal? Despite the centrality of evidence use in recent curriculum guidelines, we don\'t yet know as much as we should about how students understand and use evidence, especially when debating public policy issues. These same issues have recently become a topic of national discussion. In the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, trust and distrust of evidence (and of the candidates and their surrogates) played a big role in citizens\' attitudes and judgments. Journalists and pundits\' explanations of the election results drew on terms such as fake news, bubbles, post-truth, and social media echo chambers. These national concerns have direct relevance for classrooms today as teachers grapple with students\' complex and often competing understandings of evidence and evidence use. Acquiring and processing evidence Psychologists have found that when people consider evidence during the process of making up their minds about candidates, issues, and other questions they care about, they tend to engage in motivated reasoning (Clark & Avery, 2016). In other words, we process information in ways that reinforce our existing beliefs, values, and ideas. We spend more time critiquing information that challenges our views, and we seek out information that reinforces our views. These reasoning strategies are not unique to politics; the same dynamics affect a whole host of other judgments every day. When it comes to evidence, our "filters" play a big role. Many of us get news from social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, via newsfeeds customized to our personal likes and dislikes; decades ago, most of us watched the same three channels on TV or read the same regional or national newspapers. Which brings us to the issue of real and fake news. When it comes to discriminating between the two, most people just aren\'t very good at it. Shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Stanford University researcher Sam Wineburg and colleagues shared findings from a study of nearly 8,000 students, from middle school to college age, about their ability to distinguish between real news written by journalists and advertisements sponsored by other groups to mimic real news. Wineburg and McGrew (2016) reported that 80% to 90% of the teenagers they studied had difficulty distinguishing between real and fake news. We believe that teaching young people how to thoughtfully engage in accessing, evaluating, and using sources and information--particularly in this era of information proliferation--is crucial in a democracy. This concern drove our study. Analyzing students\' use of evidence: Our approach Since 2015, we\'ve examined students\' use of evidence in secondary social studies classrooms as students deliberate about contemporary public policy issues--a line of inquiry we think is relevant to the issue of real and fake evidence (Crocco et al., 2016a, 2016b). Working with students from three Michigan high schools, we sought to learn how students evaluated the relative trustworthiness and persuasiveness of various forms of legitimate evidence and how (if at all) they drew on various sources of evidence in public policy deliberations. We hypothesized that even when faced with genuine evidence, students might find some forms more or less compelling in shaping their thinking about a topic. Research on how adults use evidence indicates that perceptions of the trustworthy and persuasive nature of evidence vary from person to person and from situation to situation. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2753492650, 'Seeing through a Preamble, Darkly: Administrative Verbosity in an Age of Populism and ‘Fake News’', 'Alec Webley (U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut)', 2018, 0, 'How does an ordinary citizen find out what the government is doing and why? One early method was pioneered by the federal Administrative Procedure Act (the “APA”). The APA law requires that when a government agency finalizes a rule, it publishes a preamble containing a “concise general statement of the rule’s basis and purpose.” But the public truth-telling function of these “preambles” has become undermined by their spectacular length, often to more than a thousand pages longer than their parent rules, making it virtually impossible for anyone (even lawyers!) to properly read them. Worse, the courts have made it clear that no rule will ever be thrown out for having a preamble that is too long — but a preamble might doom its parent rule by being too short. \r\nThis Article argues that the growth of the thousand-page preamble is not only a crying shame but quite possibly a shaming crime. The APA’s command that preambles be “concise,”, read in its proper context, requires an agency to limit what it says so as to communicate a rule’s basis and purpose effectively with the public, even (indeed especially) if the public does not comment on the proposed rule. Alas, without much thought or analysis, both agencies and courts re-purposed the preamble to facilitate technical, “hard-look” review of an agency’s reasoning, rather than serving the separate statutory mandate of effective public information. \r\nBy reading “concise” out of the statute, agencies and courts unintentionally eliminated a popular counterweight built into an act that otherwise empowered elites. By so doing, courts have deprived the administrative process of a measure of popular legitimacy, as well as a promising means of fighting false information in political life — by requiring agencies to tell a plain, accessible, and true story about a rule, and be scrutinized in their public engagement by the judiciary. I argue that in this populist moment, where the legitimacy of the administrative state is under strain, it is time to seriously consider reviving “concise,” and its vision for popular accountability, to bring a disenchanted public closer to the administrative process.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2769338897, 'The Case Against Fake News Gatekeeping by Social Networks', 'Lucas de Lima Carvalho (University of São Paulo)', 2017, 0, 'Recent events such as Brexit and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election are said to have been partly attributable to the proliferation of fake news on the Internet.

A sheepskin with the wool plucked off would be just about the right colour for a Chinaman.1Syd Stevens, The Image of Ju LyeAlthough it sounds farcical, the passage above is based on a reallife incident in Central Otago which took place in 1895. The Image of Ju Lye (first performed in 1958; published in 1961) is a littleknown musical comedy that recounts the audacious prank played by three Pakeha miners who had learnt about the mysterious disappearance of a Chinese storekeeper in Alexandra. The miners modified a sheep's carcass to look like the decomposing corpse of the missing Ah Fook Hu and planted their effigy in a place where it was soon discovered. Incredibly, it was not until the official post-mortem that authorities discovered the effigy to be a sheep. The body of Ah Fook Hu was never found and his fate remains a mystery today.Known as the 'Lost Chinaman Hoax', this bizarre incident has the status of a colourful but obscure footnote in the annals of New Zealand history. On one hand, the hoax appears to be nothing more significant than a foolhardy prank; on the other, it is arresting because it raises a shockingly racist notion: namely, that the physical distinction between Chinese people and animals is not particularly evident. Such a suggestion seems downright outrageous today, yet the failure of witnesses in 1895 to tell the difference between a sheep's carcass and the body of a Chinese man was a genuine mistake, not a deliberate act of racism. So does this incident embody, so to speak, the way in which Pakeha New Zealanders saw Chinese people in the late nineteenth century? Were Chinese bodies truly perceived as monstrous?This essay locates the singular events of the 'Lost Chinaman Hoax' within the broader context of New Zealand sinophobia in the late nineteenth century. I trace the shifts in New Zealand racial sentiments since the 1890s by analysing how a 1950s musical comedy recounts the story of the hoax. Written by Syd Stevens and with a musical score composed by Ewen Cameron, The Image of Ju Lye was first performed in 1958 and revived in the following two decades.2 Produced in a period of easing sinophobia, the play makes striking revisions to the original incident. I am interested in accounting for these, and in unpacking the deeper implications of the hoax itself: while the use of animal remains to impersonate a 'Chinaman' is obviously irreverent, it also enacts the ontological ambiguity that surrounded Chinese bodies within the Pakeha imagination. The Image of Ju Lye literally fleshes out this uncertainty in several scenes, making the play a more ambivalent text than it would initially seem. Like the actual prank, which had provoked varied responses in its contemporary society, the play both deploys and unsetdes racial stereotypes. Indeed, nineteenth century suspicions about the abnormal disposition of Chinese bodies encompassed a host of anxieties beyond an outright belief in white racial superiority, and I begin by teasing out these undercurrents.An Indeterminate SpeciesIn the latter part of the nineteendi century, the physical bodies of Chinese migrants assumed a variety of menacing forms in popular New Zealand representations. Typically depicted as a massive human wave which threatened to swamp the Pakeha presence in New Zealand, Chinese bodies were also portrayed as filthy, disease-ridden, mindless beings stupefied by opium. Often, they were envisaged as not wholly human; Charles Ferrali notes that newspaper cartoons regularly represented the Chinese as 'a hybrid or indeterminate species, part human but also part ape, octopus, or insect. The prominent teeth drawn by cartoonists of the nineteenth century suggested something rodent-like'.3 Such monstrous images reflected a prevailing belief that Chinese migrants posed a grave danger to New Zealand. …", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2770167381, 'Fake News on Migrants)', 'Anna Michailovna Sosnovskaya ', 2017, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2768130828, 'In the Dark: Sex, Lies, and Fake News in Sam Gold’s Othello', 'Alisa Zhulina Sniderman (Harvard University)', 2017, 0, 'Sam Gold’s production of Othello explores the interrelated themes of war and the cultural construction of identity by foregrounding the play’s encounters between Christianity and Islam.

These costs, which should be included in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) from a societal perspective, have a considerable impact on cost-effectiveness estimates. However, they are often omitted in published CEAs. It is therefore uncertain whether choosing a societal perspective changes priority setting in future research as compared to a healthcare perspective. Objectives To identify research priorities regarding the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention for subthreshold panic disorder using value of information (VOI) analysis and to investigate to what extent priority setting depends on the perspective. Methods We calculated the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention for panic disorder from a healthcare perspective and a societal perspective. We performed a VOI analysis, which estimates the expected value of eliminating the uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates, for both perspectives. Results From a healthcare perspective the early intervention was more effective at higher costs compared to usual care (€17,144 per QALY), whereas it was cost-saving from a societal perspective. Additional research to eliminate parameter uncertainty was valued at €129.7 million from a healthcare perspective and €29.5 million from a societal perspective. Additional research on the early intervention utility gain was most valuable from a healthcare perspective, whereas from a societal perspective additional research would generate little added value.

There was no association between internet use and basic demographics such as age or geographical region of the focus groups. Patients considered time constraints and the fast pace in which an overwhelming amount of information is often presented by the provider as major barriers to successful provider-patient interactions. If Web-based channels were used, the participants perceived information obtained through Web-based channels as more helpful than information received in the provider's office (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based resources are increasingly used by patients with bipolar disorder and their family members to educate themselves about the disease and its treatment. Although provider-patient interactions are frequently perceived to be burdened with time constraints, Web-based information sources are considered reliable and helpful. Future research should explore how high-quality websites could be used to empower patients and improve provider-patient interactions with the goal of enhancing shared decision making between patients and providers.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2929862482, 'Research Proving the Truth about Depresses such as Mental Disorder and some other Diseases based on Prof. Momtchil Dobrev-Halachev “Theory of Vortex Fields” and “Cosmological Theory of Information” and Prof. Mariola Garibova’s and Prof. Momtchil Dobrev-Halachev’s “Theory of Universum”and “Energetic-Informational Medicine” and “Energetic-Informational Psychiatry”', 'Momtchil Dobrev Halachev , Mariola Garibova , Alexander Gariboff ', 2019, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2939211778, 'Adults with probable developmental coordination disorder selectively process early visual, but not tactile information during action preparation.

Here, EEG signals elicited by visual and tactile stimuli were recorded while adult participants with and without probable DCD (pDCD) performed a motor task. The task cued reaching movements towards a location in visible peripersonal space as well as an area of unseen personal space. Event-related potentials elicited by visual and tactile stimuli revealed that visual processing was strongly affected by movement preparation in the pDCD group, even more than in controls. However, in contrast to the controls, tactile processing in unseen space was unaffected by movement preparation in the pDCD group. The selective use of sensory information from vision and proprioception is fundamental for the adaptive control of movements, and these findings suggest that this is impaired in DCD. Additionally, the pDCD group showed attenuated motor rhythms (beta: 13–30\u202fHz) over sensorimotor regions following cues to prepare movements towards unseen personal space. The results reveal that individuals with pDCD exhibit differences in the neural mechanisms of spatial selection and action preparation compared to controls, which may underpin the sustained difficulties they experience.

Patients and professionals need good quality, independent information on medications to help them make informed treatment decisions. This paper aims to understand patients' information needs and preferences in relation to buprenorphine depot injections. DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 36 people using opioids (26 men, 10 women; 24-63\u2009years). Twelve participants were currently prescribed daily oral methadone; 12 were currently prescribed daily oral buprenorphine; and 12 were using heroin and not in treatment. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed via Iterative Categorisation. RESULTS: Participants asked many questions about depot buprenorphine injections. These related to: (i) medication purpose and availability; (ii) pharmacology; (iii) evidence base and effectiveness; (iv) safety and side effects; (v) administration and dosing; and (vi) reducing and ending treatment. Additionally, participants expressed their information preferences in terms of (i) 'format' and (ii) 'source'. Specifically, they wanted printed, verbal and electronic materials provided by people in authority, particularly patients who had already had the medication. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: All potential patients should be offered accessible information on depot buprenorphine to enable them to consider their options and participate meaningfully in treatment decision making. We recommend that further qualitative research is undertaken to produce informative video material that describes patient experiences of receiving depot buprenorphine. This should help to balance biomedical knowledge with lay knowledge, so facilitating more informed discussions when decisions about depot buprenorphine treatment are made.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2950250460, 'INFORMATION DISORDER IN THE GLAM SECTOR: THE CHALLENGES OF CROWD SOURCED CONTRIBUTIONS', 'Saima Qutab , Michael David Myers , Lesley A Gardner (University of Auckland)', 2019, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2951708392, 'A Suggestion of Converting Protein Intrinsic Disorder to Structural Entropy Using Shannon’s Information Theory', 'Hao-Bo Guo , Yue Ma , Gerald A.

This study aimed to compare the trend and characteristics of occupational mental disorder and suicide, as well as the national policy for preventive measures in these three countries. Methods A comprehensive literature search of relevant articles in English were retrieved from PubMed, irrespective of publication date. The search keywords used were occupational, work-related, mental, psychiatric, compensation, compensated, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Official statistical data, recognition guideline and national preventive measures regarding occupational mental disorder in respective countries were also obtained. Results In Japan, the number of compensated cases of occupational mental disorder has increased substantially since 1999, particularly among young workers. While in Korea, the trend was more steadily increasing. However, in Taiwan only very small number of patients with mental disorder received compensation. An acute stressful event was the most common reason for approval in Korea. In Japan, change in workload and work quality accounted for an important stressor, including for the suicide cases. Discussion The guideline for occupational mental disorder recognition came into place in Japan in 1999, and has influenced the development of guidelines in Korea in 2006 and Taiwan in 2009. All three countries recognised mental disorders as compensable occupational diseases, but the diagnosis entitled in the compensation insurance differed.

The aim of this study was to acquire more evidence on this topic by testing the hypothesis that BPD patients are characterized by a negative evaluation bias and reduced visual exploration in response to socio-emotional content. Moreover, the association between the previous conceptualizations and typical dysfunctional processes in BPD were evaluated. Methods Fifty-four socio-emotional pictures were administered to 20 female BPD patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) divided into three blocks characterized by different stimulus durations (500\xa0ms, 3s, 18s). Self-reported and eye-tracking data were collected during the experiment. Results BPD patients showed lower valence ratings and reduced visual exploration of socio-emotional pictures compared to HCs. Visual exploration in BPD was affected by exposure time with reduced exploration in response to prolonged stimuli presentation. Dysfunctional features and pre-task negative affectivity level in BPD were correlated with self-reported evaluations and eye-tracking data. Limitations Possible effects of gender on emotional responsivity could not be addressed given the female composition of our sample. Moreover, the role of psychiatric symptoms and medications should be addressed in future research.

Grade 2 is a moderate form in which the individual develops and shares false information with the intent of making money and political gain, but not with the intent of harming people. Grade 3 is a severe form in which the individual develops and shares false information with the intent of harming others. The management of this disorder requires the management of false information, which is rumor surveillance, targeted messaging and community engagement. Repeated sufferers at the Grade 1 level, all sufferers from grade 2 and 3 levels need psycho-social counseling and sometimes require strong regulations and enforcement to control such information disorder. The most critical intervention is to be mindful of the fact that not all posts in social media and news are real, and need to be interpreted carefully.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2943932610, 'Alternative Facts and Fake News: Digital mediation and The Affective Spread of Hate in the Era of Trump', 'Kayla Keener (George Mason University)', 2019, 0, 'The role of negative affects such as fear and hate, their manifestation in atmospheres, manipulability, and mobilization as a response to threat perception play a pivotal role in the current political conjuncture.

By placing an internationally known mystery, a piece of cloth with a miracle attached, into this melting pot Harry Gove has added just the right amount of spice to provide the reader with a delicious feast of religion, rivalry and research. This is not a book for those who simply want to know if the shroud dates from the time of Christ. You can easily skip to the middle of the book to find that information if you wish. However, as the author suggests, those believers who do this are most likely to remain believers regardless of the outcome of radiocarbon dating. Those non-believers who are wanting to have their positions affirmed are already so convinced of the non-authenticity of the garment that it would probably make no difference to them either way. This book is more than a date; it is a tale that reveals as much about human nature as it does about carbon dating or the shroud itself. Harry Gove is a nuclear physicist who worked in the field of accelerator mass spectrometry, a technique that required only a minute sample of material to provide a radiocarbon date. The availability of such a technique emerged in the late 1970s, just when renewed scientific interest in the dating of the shroud raised its profile. Harry Gove and his colleagues just happened to be in the right place at the right time. The tale that led to the eventual release of material for the dating, the rivalry between groups, both religious and scientific, forms the main spine of the book. I found it a long read but the author managed to keep my attention throughout, largely through his anecdotal style but also his ability to evaluate the human condition from a relatively unimpassioned standpoint. As he says repeatedly throughout the book, he had no personal desire to know the shroud's authenticity - in fact he could see very good arguments for leaving it as it stood: a mystery to some, a holy relic or a hoax to others.

A relationship between them was observed in TD children, but not in children with ASD. However, this relationship remains unexamined in other age groups. To clarify whether this lack of association is maintained throughout development in individuals with ASD, we aimed to assess the relationship between salivary OT levels and attention to social information in adolescents and adults with and without ASD. Methods We recruited male adolescents and adults with ASD (n = 17) and TD participants (n = 24). Using the all-in-one eye-tracking system Gazefinder, we measured the percentage fixation time allocated to social information. We also measured the salivary OT levels and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) of participants. Subsequently, we confirmed group differences and conducted a correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between these three measures. Results Salivary OT levels did not show any significant difference between the ASD and TD groups and were negatively correlated with the AQ in the whole-group analysis, but not in within-group analysis. Individuals with ASD had significantly lower percentage fixation times than did TD individuals for eye regions in human faces with/without mouth motion, for upright biological motion, and for people regions in the people and geometry movies. The percentage of fixation for geometric shapes in the people and geometry movies was significantly higher in the ASD than in the TD group. In the TD group, salivary OT levels were positively correlated with percentage fixation times for upright biological motion and people and negatively correlated with inverted biological motion and geometry. However, no significant correlations were found in the ASD group. Conclusions Our exploratory results suggest that salivary OT levels in adolescents and adults with ASD are less indicative of attention to social stimuli than they are in TD adolescents and adults.

Sixteen resting-state networks (RSNs) with the highest spatial correlation between NT individuals (n = 20) and individuals with ASD (n = 20) were analyzed. The dynamic lag pattern variation between each RSN pair was investigated using DLA, which measures time lag variation between each RSN pair combination and statistically defines how these lag patterns are altered between ASD and NT groups. DLA analyses indicated that 10.8% of the 120 RSN pairs had statistically significant (P-value <0.003) dynamic lag pattern differences that survived correction with surrogate data thresholding. Alterations in lag patterns were concentrated in salience, executive, visual, and default-mode networks, supporting earlier findings of impaired brain connectivity in these regions in ASD. 92.3% and 84.6% of the significant RSN pairs revealed shorter mean and median temporal lags in ASD versus NT, respectively.

Using an ultra-fast neuroimaging procedure, we investigated communication across brain regions in adults with ASD compared with neurotypical (NT) individuals. We found that ASD individuals had altered information flow patterns across brain regions. Atypical patterns were concentrated in salience, executive, visual, and default-mode network areas of the brain that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2060479361, 'The story of a largely unknown evolution – Germ theory hoax', 'Milton Wainwright (University of Sheffield), Sulaiman Ali Alharbi (King Saud University)', 2011, 0, 'The Piltdown Man debacle provides us with the most infamous forgery in science.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of information provided by teacher informant assessments (INFAs) of ADHD symptoms, and the implications of aggregation algorithms in combing parents' information, i.e. using 'or-rule' (endorsement by either one informant) versus 'and-rule' (endorsement by both informants). METHOD: Teacher ratings on Conners scales and clinical data from parental accounts on 1383 probands and their siblings from the IMAGE study were analysed. The psychometric properties of teacher and combined ratings using the item response theory model (IRT) are presented. Kappa coefficients, intraclass correlations and linear regression were employed. RESULTS: First, teacher endorsement of symptoms is located in a narrow part of the trait continuum close to the average levels. Symptoms exhibit comparable perception in the measurement of the trait(s) with similar discrimination ability and information (reliability). Second, the IRT properties of the 'or-rule' ratings are predominantly influenced by parent-INFAs; and the 'and-rule' ratings predominantly by teacher-INFAs ratings. Third, parent-teacher INFAs agreement was low, both for individual items (κ\u2009=\u20090.01-0.15) and for dimensional scores (r\u2009=\u20090.12-0.16). The 'or-rule' captured milder expressions of ADHD symptoms, whereas the 'and-rule' indexed greater severity of ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Parent and teacher-INFAs provide different kinds of information, while both are useful.

Unlike existing instruments, the innovative self-report Daily Routine and Autonomy questionnaire (DRA) addresses their level of and desire for independence in activities throughout a full daily routine. This study describes the DRA development, explores its psychometric properties and internal consistency reliability using full-information factor analysis (FIFA), and identifies levels of and desire for independence among adolescents with ASD. Methods Seventy-two Israeli adolescents with ASD (58 boys and 14 girls) aged 11–19 years (M\xa0=\xa014.59, SD\xa0= 1.61) completed the DRA. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and R. Internal consistency reliability, FIFA, Spearman's correlations, t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank were conducted to assess relationships and differences between the DRA parts. Results The FIFA revealed three factors with high sum-of-squared loadings (4.09–5.13). Of the 31 DRA items, 28 had factor loadings higher than 0.35 and were retained in the study questionnaire. The DRA had moderate-to-high internal reliability for factors (α\xa0=\xa00.65–0.84) and total scores (α\xa0=\xa00.86–0.90). Participants showed partial independence in most daily activities, with high desire for independence in social and leisure activities. Significant gaps in half of the DRA items indicate the participants' desire for independence was significantly higher than their independence level.

ABSTRACT : This research aims at discussing the use of Digital Information and Communication Technologies in the literacy and learning process of people with the Autism Spectrum Disorder. As a methodological procedure, a survey of the national scientific articles published between 2014 and 2019 was made available in the Portal of Capes and Scielo journals. To do so, an advanced search was performed, combining the descriptors Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism, Technology, Literacy, Education, Learning and Software. The texts were selected according to inclusion criteria: national surveys that investigated the use of these technologies for literacy and learning of people with the disorder published between 2014 and 2019. As exclusion criteria: health-related articles; studies in which the Digital Information and Communication Technologies were used with people without the disorder and articles repeated in both databases . As a result, 198 papers were found and, after analysis and application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, there were seven works that contemplated the theme. The studies analyzed demonstrated the contributions of technologies for literacy and learning of people with the disorder in question, but there is still more research needs to be done in this area .

Unfortunately, I fear that this is only a minor cause and that the true explanation is much more insidious, with serious ramifications for all scientists, not just climatologists. As documented in several recent publications [e.g., Mayer, 2010], climate scientists are currently bearing the brunt of a deliberate, antiscience, misinformation campaign that is financed by certain fossil fuel companies and propagated by certain conservative radio programs, television organizations, and think tanks. Verosub wonders why no one has offered an explanation for why scientists worldwide are engaged in this supposed hoax. But explanations are frequently offered on conservative talk shows. For example, I found myself listening to The War Room With Quinn and Rose last fall while driving in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area and was appalled by the scenario painted in the show by cohost Jim Quinn. Apparently, all academics are socialists. Further, the Earth is not warming—it has been getting cooler since 1999. Quinn continued with this gem: Climate warming is an international conspiracy, funded by billionaire George Soros, perpetrated by scientists everywhere, and intended to delude governments into spending vast sums of money to counter a non-existent threat until the governments become bankrupt. Then in the ensuing chaos, socialists can take over and form a world socialist government.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2110962337, 'Environmental hype and hoax', 'S. F.

This itch in her mind turned into two books, The Life and Death of the Great American School System, a careful mea culpa regarding testing and a data-driven attack on data-fixation, and, most recently, Reign of Error. As a New York University research professor of education, she also founded an organization, the Network for Public Education (NPE). All of these efforts are aimed fundamentally at the primary and secondary educational systems in the U.S., but the arguments are relevant to community colleges, particularly in the Obama administration. Community colleges today face such questions of "reform"--Ravitch often puts this word in doubtful quotes--and the community college may fall for the same hoax. Ravitch outlines the view of "reformers" in chapters 3-8 of Life and Death and chapters 2-4 and 14-20 of Reign of Error as seeing schools preparing children to become participants in the society\'s economy. This vision, argues Ravitch, emphasizes two elements: standardized tests and social engineering. Standardized tests are the first social modality by which academic competition is exercised. At this level, a child is getting practice and developing skills that suit one for a competitive economy: self-control, the efficient use of instrumental reason, calculations of utility, innovation, initiative-taking, and so on; but more specifically, job-relevant skills come along eventually, and by assessing disaggregated skills instead of the aggregated judgment that grades make, the system can more precisely sort its future workers. Educational services deliverers get their own grade, from their output--from the scores that their students make, assessed over time. The other element comparative testing emphasizes is a social engineering aspect: that people of differential abilities and aptitudes will be sorted by testing into those career and academic pathways in which they will be comparatively advantaged--on the Adam Smith and David Ricardo model, more or less. Market utility is the appropriate standard of judgment for an individual, according to the reformers\' view, because it is the standard of judgment for a collectivity. The strength of corporations (the "bottom line") and countries (military, GDP) is similarly assessed quantitatively. In advanced societies, the citizen labor force is stratified according to performance, which is measured by one "earning what one deserves"--by differential monetary life outcomes. A well-formed education system thus prepares each person for the slot in the economy in which she is most apt to attain her greatest comparative advantage--that which will, among the measurable outcomes, result in her maximum lifetime income-earning potential. Privatization melds public and private interest, in this view, because it allows maximum room for competitive pressures to sort out to any desired level of detail the most efficient producers of society-specific, needed workforce skills. Assessing student learning disaggregated by skill performance facilitates tracking students into the most contributory pathways and prepares them for competitive job-hunting and job-keeping. Similarly, assessing instruction drives teachers and teaching institutions into the most efficient delivery of the most demanded knowledge and skills. Anything that gets in the way of this quantized, data-driven approach is a market inefficiency--as well as, on the reformers\' view, a social anachronism and a political albatross. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2335269478, 'The case involving the Colorado family and the balloon hoax raises questions about adults who exploit children.

One of these research areas of knowledge is the process of memory bias or information processing in mental disorders. This research is a descriptive and causal-comparative study aimed at investigating selective information processing and role of cognitive attention in this process in patients with social phobia. To this end, two groups of patients with social phobia and normal individuals, each containing 20 individuals, were selected and compared through cluster and random sampling with replacement. The subjects were tested using Stroop test, Recognition test and three questionnaires including Social Anxiety Questionnaire, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. For data analysis, one- factor and two-factor variance analysis test with repeated measures and Scheffe post hoc test were applied. The results indicated that patients with social phobia disorder compared to the control group spend more time processing the sings. Further processing of phobia signs was another result of this research. A significant difference was found between the recognition scores of the two groups. This confirms that the processing has been conscious. No significant difference was observed in examining the effect of different anxiety levels. But patients with social phobia disorder who had higher depression levels spent more time processing the signs. Additionally, it was found that variables of age and education have no effect on the process of attentional bias. Considering the obtained results, it can be said that the content of signs has been effective at the time of color determination. Thus, interference effect cannot be attributed to factors such as the length of words or their difficulty or other factors. Further, factors other than anxiety have been effective in slow performance of patients. Existence of schemas commensurate with the threatening signs in memory and cognitive avoidance (attending to stimuli associated with emotional concerns) has led to bias and conscious processing.

Tweets classified as potentially related to auditory hallucinations were proportionately higher between 23:00 and 5:00 in comparison to tweets not classified. This may indicate a clinically significant relationship between sleep and PLEs in the general population, a notion supported by the literature. Based on our previous investigation, the current study aimed to explore whether this methodology could be amended to generate datasets regarding sleep experiences in people who self-report a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.\r\nApproachThe current investigation seeks to establish if it is feasible to generate anonymised datasets regarding sleep by extracting information from the timelines of people who self-report a psychotic diagnosis. A text mining method was implemented that utilised rule-based semantic filters that aimed to identify self-reported diagnoses. This focused on occurrences of personal and possessive pronouns to detect the subjectivity of tweets, as well as potential diagnostic verb indicators and any mentions of other related factors. For each diagnostic tweet, we collected information from user timelines. A sleep-related classifier was then implemented, which used lexical features (e.g. bag-of-words, part-of-speech tags) to predict whether a given tweet refers to sleep-related experience.\r\nResultsAfter training the classifier on the bag-of-words model, the most informative words which contributed to the performance of the classifier were: ‘sleep’, ‘can’t awake’, ‘never’, ‘stress’. Part-of-speech tags (e.g. verbs, adverbs) were also important features. The classification accuracy of the ‘bag-of-words’ model was better than the ‘part-of-speech’ model.\r\nThrough the method outlined herein, we were able to improve the quality of the generated datasets in comparison to the previous investigation. This methodology also facilitated the mining of individual Twitter users timelines who stated a personal diagnosis. To this end, an additional filter was implemented to identify tweets regarding sleep experience. The potential relationship between sentiment and temporality expressed in diagnosis and sleep experiences are also discussed.\r\nConclusionsThe results from this study have implications for mental health research on Twitter. Specifically, the refinements in the methodology enabled retrieval of two high quality datasets regarding psychosis and sleep. Therefore it is feasible other psychosis-related phenomena (e.g. visual hallucinations, delusions, medication) could also be applied as separate filters to create one dataset of psychosis-related experiences within individuals diagnosed with psychosis.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2935638271, 'Do You Really Know If It’s True?

In response, Facebook has proposed and tested the idea of users flagging and rating news articles and sources, much akin to how consumers rate products and services on the Internet. One obvious challenge with this crowdsourced rating approach is whether the users really know enough to rate news articles and sources. Perhaps, a side benefit of asking users to evaluate an article—and asking about their personal experience with the event described in the article—is making them realize that they do not know enough about the event to make an accurate judgment, thus pushing them to become more skeptical. We asked 68 social media users to assess the believability of 42 social media headlines. We found that, while users were generally more likely to believe articles that agreed with their point of view, asking users to rate pushed them to think more critically about the truthfulness of the articles. Moreover, once users had been asked to rate some articles, they remained critical of other articles as well, even without the rating prompt. Overall, our findings suggest that asking users to evaluate the truthfulness of articles may not only produce rating information that can be a useful reference at a later point in time but also have an immediate benefit of alerting users to think more critically about all articles they see.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2141448070, 'Romans in Tucson?: The Story of an Archaeological Hoax', 'Don Burgess ', 2009, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2594700065, 'Fake news, truth and ideology: Galileo, censorship and nursing.', 'Derek Sellman (University of Alberta)', 2017, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2132394601, 'The Realism of the Black Racism Hoax', 'Paul M.

Automatic processing of affective stimuli provides information about valence (positive vs. negative) and relevance of valence (self vs. other). Aims The objectives of our study were to investigate efficiency of automatic processing of valence and relevance at a semantic level in BPD compared to healthy individuals. Methods A masked affective priming task, varying valence and relevance of prime and target adjectives, was administered to 33\xa0women with BPD and 33\xa0healthy women. The forward and backward masked primes were shown for 50ms. Subjects had the task to evaluate target words. Results In the whole sample, a significant affective priming effect and a significant relevance priming effect occurred. Presence of comorbid depressive disorder was positively correlated with extent of affective priming. BPD patients did not differ in affective priming from healthy individuals but they exhibited less relevance priming. Conclusions According to our data efficiency of automatic recognition and processing of valence information at a semantic level is not impaired in BPD compared to healthy individuals. However, BPD patients appear to be less able to perceive and differentiate automatically self- vs. other-relevance during the perception of affective information than healthy controls.

This is no accident, since Cape Town was for many years (since 1652, in fact) the only fortified and inhabited European settlement in the southern hemisphere. Thus when astronomers in The Netherlands, France, and England turned their attention to mapping the southern skies it was to the Cape that they brought their instruments. In addition, the mother city of South Africa is only about eighteen degrees east of the Greenwich meridian in London, so that observations of the skies in London and Cape Town could be made from approximately the same longitude. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, star-gazing was not merely a matter of academic interest; on it depended the accuracy of navigational aids used by the merchant and naval shipping of these and other nations. The interest shown in Cape Town by the British astronomical community is also evident from the construction of the Royal Observatory at the Cape in 1820 by the Admiralty. This observatory was intended to be the counterpart of the Greenwich Observatory in London (Evans 1981a:196; Warner 1995). In addition to this interest in navigational accuracy, the invention of the refracting telescope at the beginning of the seventeenth century provided the means for scientists to make star-maps of the southern skies more accurate and complete. The Dutch astronomer, Peter Kolbe, was sent to the Cape in 1705, and in 1751 a Frenchman, the Abbe De La Caille, also arrived there for this purpose (McIntyre 1951:3-5; De La Caille 1763b). The latter was considerably more successful than the former; he added 9766 stars and 42 nebulae to the celestial catalogue (De La Caille 1763a).

Our research explored: 1) bipolar disorder (BD) self-management strategies that are effective for Vancouver Island youth living with BD, and 2) the methods preferred by youth participants for sharing these strategies with their communities and support circles. Methods: The study employed a group of seven Youth Action Group (YAG) members who live with BD to work with the research team in a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework. In collaboration, we designed and executed two Vancouver Island-based Research Forums, inviting youth with BD from the wider community to share their knowledge about self-management. Qualitative (focus group), consultation (World Cafe), and arts-based (graphic facilitation) methods were utilized. Qualitative findings underwent thematic analysis within a CBPR orientation. Results: 29 youth participants with BD were recruited to the two Forums.\xa0 Focus group findings identified five overarching themes, which included: ‘Sources of self-management strategies’. Half of the focus group participants described how they used online sources to either learn more about self-management or strengthen their social support networks. World Cafe consultations indicated that, while the sample primarily used online sources for mental health information, they experienced significant barriers, namely stigma and difficulty finding credible, safe, and evidence-informed information. Conclusion: Youth engagement in BD research and knowledge exchange is feasible. Moreover, youth with BD clearly have constructive and important insights to share which, if harnessed, will help the research community to develop appropriate, effective and safe online mental health spaces for future generations.

For Brooks the hoax provides a means of selfinvention and, importantly, an invention of self at one remove.

McWhorter (2014) New York: Oxford University Press. Pp. 208. ISBN 978-0-19-936158-8After works like Word on the Street: Debunking the Myth of 'Pure' Standard English and The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language, the volume under review continues the author's work first and foremost aimed at educating the general public about issues related to language and linguistics, a highly important task as I have noted on other occasions. This time it is a manifesto, as the author states in the first sentence of the Introduction: a manifesto which takes issue with the recent rise of Neo-Whorfianism and especially its popularized version divulgated by the media. After all, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis according to which the language we speak shapes the way we perceive the world seems quite appealing and is, at first sight, also politically correct. In McWhorter's words: 'Under Whorfianism, everybody is interesting and everybody matters' (p. xvi). At the same time, it is also dangerous as it suggests that humans are not mentally alike. McWhorter's aim is to show that the 'idea of languages as pairs of glasses does not hold water in the way that we may, understandably, wish it did' (p. xvii). According to him, language is, indeed, a lens - but not upon distinct humanities but humanity in general - and languages are fascinating in their own right.The Introduction (pp. ix-xx) introduces the reader to the questions at hand: What is (Neo-) Whorfianism all about? What are the stakes? What is this book about? To some extent, I have outlined that in the preceding.In Chapter 1, 'Studies Have Shown' (pp. 3-29), McWhorter conscientiously revises recent Neo-Whorfian research which shows that language does have an effect on thought. However, this effect cannot be deemed anything but the like of insignificant milliseconds in hitting buttons during laboratory reaction tests gauging to what extent, for instance, speakers of Russian with lexical items for both 'dark blue' and 'light blue' are more sensitive to shades of blue than speakers of languages which lack this distinction. Thence, concluding that a tribe whose languages lacks numbers is bad at maths (the case of the Brazilian Piraha extensively reported upon by the media in 2004) is akin to considering that a 'tribe without cars doesn't drive' (p. 16) or 'Legless Tribe [is] Incapable of Walking Because They Have No Words for Walk' (p. 21). Rather than language shaping the way we see the world, it is culture and language-external realities which have an impact on language, for instance in the form of specific terminology such as Japanese honorifics.In order to save Whorfianism, we might fancy 'Having It Both Ways?' which is precisely the title of Chapter 2 (pp. 30-58). Unfortunately, that doesn't work either. There just is no intrinsic necessity for language A to develop, say, evidential markers, while language B, spoken in a very similar environment, does not. As McWhorter puts it: 'Worldwide, chance is, itself, the only real pattern evident in the link between languages and what their speakers are like' (p. 45). Or that bubbles (or frills or ornaments) just happen to pop up somewhere in the soup.A central point made by the author in Chapter 3, 'An Interregnum on Culture' (pp. 59-72), is that sociohistorical conditions have affected language structure throughout human history: witness, for example, the fact that languages massively acquired at some point in history as L2 such as English, Mandarin Chinese, Persian, Swahili, and Indonesian tend to be less complex than what is the norm for human language.The author returns to the currently much-debated concept of linguistic complexity in the next chapter, 'Dissing the Chinese' (pp. 73-103). As it happens, Whorfian studies have compared a limited set of grammatical features of 'National Geographic' languages with English. For the reasons elaborated in the previous chapter, the outcome is that those languages seemingly encode reality in a more elaborate or exotic way than English. …", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2586494038, 'Defective imitation of finger configurations in patients with damage in the right or left hemispheres: An integration disorder of visual and somatosensory information?', 'Manabu Okita (Kōchi University), Takashi Yukihiro (Department of Rehabilitation, Ichinose Hospital, 1-5-11, Kokutaijimachi, Nakaku, Hiroshima 730-0042, Japan), Kenzo Miyamoto (American Physical Therapy Association), Shu Morioka (American Physical Therapy Association), Hideto Kaba (Kōchi University)', 2017, 0, 'To explore the mechanism underlying the imitation of finger gestures, we devised a simple imitation task in which the patients were instructed to replicate finger configurations in two conditions: one in which they could see their hand (visual feedback: VF) and one in which they could not see their hand (non-visual feedback: NVF).

It is critical at all times, be it promoting health benefits of immunisation, importance of hand hygiene or taking personal measures for prevention of non-communicable diseases. Communication assumes even greater importance in the time of emergencies like the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. A primary vehicle for health communication is mass media like television channels, newspapers and radio channels. Methods An analysis of current trends shows that the messages emerging from mass media are getting further amplified and dispersed through digital outlets and social media platforms which have become immensely popular.

This article presents a new approach to tackle this stance detection problem, based on the combination of string similarity features with a deep neural architecture that leverages ideas previously advanced in the context of learning efficient text representations, document classification, and natural language inference. Specifically, we use bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks, together with max-pooling over the temporal/sequential dimension and neural attention, for representing (i) the headline, (ii) the first two sentences of the news article, and (iii) the entire news article. These representations are then combined/compared, complemented with similarity features inspired on other FNC-1 approaches, and passed to a final layer that predicts the stance of the article towards the headline. We also explore the use of external sources of information, specifically large datasets of sentence pairs originally proposed for training and evaluating natural language inference methods, in order to pre-train specific components of the neural network architecture (e.g., the RNNs used for encoding sentences).

The book is successful at that task, but as a consequence may have limited audience appeal. The brilliance of this book is its every day application and the easy to use worksheets. In this day of suits on copy write infringement, it is rare to find a book that so clearly encourages the reader to make copies of its pages. In fact, to assist in this endeavor, a CD is attached to the back of the book. The first section of the book is basically a series of lists of questions on topics designed to prod a parent as to what information they should share about their child. At times, it is repetitive, but the inventory of questions is organized in such a fashion that you can easily skip nonrelevant topics such as bathing, as many part time caregivers never bath their charge leaving that as a parental responsibility. The second section of the book is a series of simple essays on topics of high interest to caregivers. These essays are a type of Social Story for caregivers. ‘‘Why doesn’t the child look at me?’’ or ‘‘Why does this child talk on and on and on?’’ are relevant and useful tools to share with anyone who interacts with a child or adult with autism. The third section, detailing the case history of two families, is tedious to read, but may be useful as a point of reference.

Many of the pages are nearly blank with only a modest heading and it makes you wonder if they should have just saved the trees.

Possible misconceptions regarding news can arise due to ignorance of reality. Therefore, intervention in the form of countermeasures is of importance from a social point of view.

However, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the Global South. This paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context of Bangladesh, a country in the Global South. The spread of misinformation on Facebook in Bangladesh, a country with a population over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings. By interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in Bangladesh. Our findings show that most people in the `news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see online.

A GFC incorporates graph patterns that best distinguish true and false facts of generalized fact statements. We provide statistical measures to characterize useful patterns that are both discriminant and diversified. Second, we show that it is feasible to discover GFCs in large graphs with optimality guarantees. We develop an algorithm that performs localized search to generate a stream of graph patterns, and dynamically assemble the best GFCs from multiple GFC sets, where each set ensures quality scores within certain ranges. The algorithm guarantees a (1/2−ϵ) approximation when it (early) terminates. We also develop a space-efficient alternative that dynamically spawns prioritized patterns with best marginal gains to the verified GFCs. It guarantees a (1−1/e) approximation. Both strategies guarantee a bounded time cost independent of the size of the underlying graph. Third, to support fact checking, we develop two classifiers, which make use of top-ranked GFCs as predictive rules or instance-level features of the pattern matches induced by GFCs, respectively.

The majority of the Latvian population also condemns the physical abuse of women; however, the Istanbul Convention which deals with this matter was not ratified here. A number of factors were at play, the most significant of which was pressure exerted through the direct influence of a campaign that had been organised by opponents of the broadest understanding of human rights. Such pressure was exerted on decision makers (MPs and political parties), with indirect impact on the population via social media and the news media outlets. Campaigns by interest groups which spread opposing views are not unusual in a democratic society; however, in this case there was no discussion between the opposing parties. The public domain was not open to an interaction of views and beliefs based on arguments and critical thinking, as the argument of the opponents rested entirely upon their beliefs, whereas the supporters of the convention relied upon valid proof. This article looks at the reasons behind the failure in terms of group communication to establish a constructive discussion on a topic that was so essential to Latvian society: one which served to combat and eradicate violence against women. It also seeks to establish whether the use of an irrational form of convincing technique contradicts the logic of critical thinking, and whether the emergence of unfamiliar and/or incomprehensible concepts on the agenda of a public discussion may serve to put the brakes on the constructive discussion of women’s rights issues which is so essential today to Latvian society as a whole.

Balaban , M.I. Atagun , H.D. Ozguven ', 2014, 0, 'Purpose: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two major psychiatric illnesses that may have pathophysiological common points. Although the relationships between cognitive functions, symptoms and functionality differ for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and remain to be clarified, it’s known that cognitive dysfunction is a good candidate to be a predictor of functioning in both disorders [1]. The importance of the cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders has been substantially increasing, but we still need more sensitive and appropriate assessment tools [2]. Most instruments or tests assess only one domain, representing a single task. This narrow span is useful when examining a specific domain that is heavily impaired. In psychiatric disorders, however, most subjects are only slightly impaired and those tools with low sensitivity lack reliability and sensitivity in determining slight impairments. This study aims to evaluate capabilities of cognitive tests used to evaluate information processing in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Methods: Thirty-five patients with bipolar disorder (age 34.74+ 8.71 years, m/f: 18/17) and 32 schizophrenia patients (age 39.97+9.43 years, m/f: 23/9) enrolled into the study. Clinical examinations were performed with Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Cognitive evaluations included the Stroop Test (ST), Trail Making Test (TMT), Digit Span Test, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSS), auditory and visual Reaction Time Test (RT) and Adult Memory and Intelligence Processing Battery (AMIPB). The AMIPB has raw scores and adjusted scores according to motor speed of subjects. The t test and Pearson’s correlation tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: Visual RT, TMT-B, digit span, DSS test and 1, 2, 3 and 5th subtests of the ST did not differ between groups. Auditory RT (p = 0.004), TMT-A (p = 0.024), ST 4 (p = 0.040) tests differed between groups. There was significant difference between groups in all subtests of the AMIPB. Motor (p = 0.001), total raw score (p< 0.001), and adjusted scores (p< 0.001) of the AMIPB-A and total raw score (p = 0.002), motor speed (p = 0.013) and adjusted (p = 0.001) scores differed between groups. The AMIPB showed correlations to all other cognitive measures, both in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups with strong significance. Discussion: The AMIPB discriminated the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups. These results suggest that among many different tests to measure information processing, the AMIPB is a sensitive test in quality and quantities of speed and accuracy for psychiatric disorders. The battery also include working memory demands, therefore it evaluates different aspects of information processing. Information processing is related to basic components of cognition including working memory and executive functions (judgment, decision making, etc.). Although all other tests include properties of one aspect of basic components of information processing, the AMIPB has interactions with different basic components of cognition. This wealthy of interactions may provide broader portfolio of capabilities and greater sensitivity for the battery.

In this talk, I will describe algorithms to identify two different aspects of undesirable actors and acts on Wikipedia: vandals and hoaxes. First, I will present the state-of-the-art system to detect vandals on Wikipedia called VEWS, which stands for Vandal Early Warning System [1]. Vandals are editors who make unconstructive edits on Wikipedia. VEWS models the editing behavior of all editors on Wikipedia, both benign and vandals, and then builds upon the differences in their behavior to identify the vandals. VEWS achieves an accuracy of over 85% and outperforms ClueBot NG and STiki, the best known algorithms that fight vandalism. Moreover, on average, VEWS detects vandals 2.39 edits before ClueBot NG. Furthermore, the combination of the two gives a fully automatic vandal early warning system with even higher accuracy. Second, I will present an in-depth study of hoaxes on Wikipedia [2].

Also, heterogeneity of the children contingents and the problems they had to face has shown that these institutions have no clear profiles, an aspect which has result in lower quality work. Data from a cross sectional on 1177 children (619 boys and 558 girls) aged {7-10 years old; grade 1-4) randomly selected in Tirana, using body coordination test for children-KTK (Kiphard and Schilling 1974, 2007), show that children categorized at normal level represented only 30.5% of the entire sample, while almost half of the sample were categorized below the normal level as having moderate motor disorder. To be concerned is the number of children that fall into the level of severe motor disorder (19.4%) that will be the focus of future studies to be evaluated for having probably motor coordination disorder (possible DCD).

A potential problem of this approach is that the number of words in the dictionary is very large, it may be difficult to construct a Bayesian network using all of words.

Fake news in a layman understanding is said to be information fabricated without a source or element of originality. Most time, it creates tension, killings and pandemonium which are not good for the peace and unity of Nigeria and the world at large. The source of information for this study came from secondary source. From the study, we observed that the major causes of fake news are; quest for relevance, hostile government and civil actors, poor regularization / of the internet and money making. The effect of it has been so bad most especially now Nigeria is facing different intra crises like Fulani-Herdsmen and Farmers, Militancy, and so on which goes a long way to create tension, killings and pandemonium just like stated above. As a result of the above, we recommend the following: There is need to always confirm the source of information (social media accounts often try to appear as if they are from legitimate news sites), check different sources to confirm the authentication of the information you are reading. There is need to always penalize those blogs or media outlets that post fake news no matter the circumstance. By so doing, it will serve as deterrent to others using it as a way to gain relevance or for whatever reason.

Shaughnessy ', 2015, 0, 'NAJP: Professor Glass, first of all, what led you and Dr. Berliner to write the book about 50 Lies and Myths About American Education? GG: Actually, we put "myths" first and "lies" second. And as we contemplated the project, I was uncomfortable with the idea of accusing anyone of being a liar. It seemed to me that there are many opportunities to misperceive reality or delude oneself when studying something as complex as schooling, and that this is different from willful distortion. So I wanted to keep the word "lies" out of the title of the book. What caused us to write the book? Outrage! Outrage at the corruption and malfeasance we were observing every day in the charter school movement and across the entire spectrum of modern-day education reform. NAJP: Let\'s start with some general questions, then focus on some statistics. Private schools are "better" than public schools-True or False-and where is the evidence? GG: False. The evidence is right here in a book entitled The Public School Advantage: Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools by Christopher A. Lubienski and Sarah T. Lubienski, published by the University of Chicago Press (2013). (Editor Note--Also see Reign of Error: The Hoax of the Privatization Movement and the Danger to America\'s Schools, by Ravitch, 2013) NAJP: Home-schooled kids do better across the board than kids in the public schools. Lie, hoax or truth? GG: Language is important. What exactly does "do better" mean? Does it mean, a) "given two hypothetically identical twins, one of whom is home-schooled, the other educated in a traditional public school, the home-schooled child will learn more," or, does it mean b) "children whose parents choose to school them at home score higher on achievement tests irrespective of where they learn"? The answer to a) is "No, home schooling is not more effective." The answer to b) is "Yes, the population of home-schooled children is more advantaged and higher scoring than students in general." So let\'s ask the relevant question: An individual parent faced with the decision to home-school or not, should that parent expect the child to learn more at home or at school? The vast majority of parents who try home schooling have answered: "I might try teaching reading and a couple other things at home, but by the time my child reaches middle school, I don\'t know enough math, science or even social studies to compete with professional teachers in real schools." NAJP: One variable that seems to be beaten to death--The teacher is the most important factor or variable in student success. (Or should we be thinking univariately in a multivariate world)? GG: What appears on the surface to be a compliment proves eventually to be a set-up. If teachers are this powerful, then if anything goes wrong (i.e., if the child scores low on a paper-pencil achievement test), it\'s the teacher\'s fault--not the fault of absent parents, illness, unsafe neighborhoods, poor diets, and a host of influences that deprive so many children of a chance to succeed in life. NAJP: Students succeed because teachers know their subject matter--or teachers succeed because teachers are well trained in pedagogy? Which is it? GG: John Dewey was the master of exposing these false dichotomies. It is both. There can be no learning without learning something--content; and no content is learned unless it is competently taught. NAJP: Class size is a crucial variable--and what does multiple regression tell us about class size (if anything)? GG: The second meta-analysis ever performed was performed on the corpus of studies of school class size and achievement discussed in a book entitled School class size: Research and Policy (Glass, Cohen, Smith, & Filby, 1982). Is "class size" crucial? No. In the effective range of possible reduction in class sizes (let\'s say, from 25 to 20), the increase in learning would be negligible. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2018909774, 'P.1.140 The GAMIAN-Europe BEAM survey, Dutch part: Information on current treatment of bipolar disorder generated by a patient questionnaire', 'E.M.

Furthermore, we consider that PR managers can use either reactive PR strategies to counteract online fake news regarding an organization, or communication stratagems to temporarily transform the organization served into a potential source of fake news. Each reactive PR strategy can be a potential solution to respond to different types of online fake news. Although these possibilities seem to be extensive, in some cases, PR managers can find them ineffective. In our view, this cluster of reactive PR strategies is not a panacea for managing fake news in the online environment and different strategic approaches may be need, such as communication stratagems.

Furthermore, these two paths implemented with convolutional neural networks (CNN) are jointly optimized to complete semi-supervised learning.

Due to the availability of the Internet, a lot of user-generated content is produced across the globe in a single day using various social media platforms. Nowadays, it has become very easy to create fake news and propagate it worldwide within a short period of time. Despite receiving significant attention in the research community, fake news detection did not improve significantly due to insufficient context-specific news data. Most of the researchers have analyzed the fake news problem as a binary classification problem, but many more prediction classes exist. In this research work, experiments have been conducted using a tree-based Ensemble Machine Learning framework (Gradient Boosting) with optimized parameters combining content and context level features for fake news detection. Recently, adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, which are chosen to optimize a single common objective function.

In the absence of adequate rules for the government of consumption, we can see this technological disadjustment symptomatised in a phenomenon of ‘generalised addiction’. We are living through one such period, struggling in the wake of disintegrating older social norms, and prior to the birth of new ones better able to mitigate the toxic potential of our technological pharmaka. But emerging work in addiction research facilitates the argument, made here, that epidemics of generalised addiction are not unique to the digital era. The works of Plato can be interpreted as a response to an addiction epidemic in fifth-century Athens, which was attributable, in turn, to the technological revolution of alphabetic writing. The comparison of then and now, two periods of technological change bringing political turmoil, throws up multiple parallels with the ongoing transformations of digital culture. Athenian symposia functioned as sanctuaries where aristocrats, displaced from their traditional position at the heart of an increasingly chaotic city, retreated to experiment with religious, poetic and pharmaceutical oblivion. They accordingly bring to mind both the anxiety-relieving ‘zones’ of escape and disavowal sought out by addicts in using, and the internet echo chambers into which we retreat from an increasingly fragmented public sphere. In a move that hints at an exit strategy for our own period of generalised addiction, Plato builds on the logical thinking made possible by the new technology of writing to reinvent and readjust a dislocated political morality.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2326441929, 'Misinformation on the Origin of Eucaryotes', 'Norm Pace (University of Colorado Boulder)', 2012, 0, "Groan.

Nine participants (five males) with mild to moderate disease took part in a qualitative study using Photovoice to explore the lived experience of DM1.

The subject is still under investigation, but sources believe that it has a strong link to the recent US boikot (sic) of the racism conference held in the South African city of Durban. CNN information sources disclose (sic) that some of the masterminds might be in hideaway in South Africa. Strong links has (sic) also been made between SA and Lybia (sic).\' It was reported by the South African (SA) newspaper media that this email had significant national, international, and financial repercussions and influenced relations between the United States (US) and the SA governments at a difficult time in the history of the US. It reportedly resulted in the decline of the SA currency and had a negative effect on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ("Bolandse broers", 2001; Coetzee, 2001; Damon, 2001a; Momberg, 2001). The Conradie brothers, allegedly responsible for the creation and dissemination of the email, were charged with sabotage and fraud, but eventually all charges against them were dropped. This paper presents the details of the incident in the form of a case study as reported by various SA newspapers, in particular Beeld, Burger, Business Day, Cape Argus, Cape Times, Citizen, Pretoria News, Rapport, Sowetan, and Star. In Barnard, De Ridder, and Pretorius (2001), we argued for the use of case studies in teaching computer ethics. Case studies present instructors with a powerful pedagogical method to, apart from sensitizing students to ethical and social concerns of computing, contribute to the development of critical reasoning and analytical skills (Gotterbarn & Riser, 1997). Furthermore, we agree with Spinello (2003, p. xiii) that \'the case study remains a popular instrument to provoke students to grapple with complicated moral problems and quandaries. Cases present such problems in a particular context ...\' The hoax email case study that took place in a SA context is presented in this paper together with a discussion thereof, and we contend that this multifaceted case study can be put to good use by computing instructors in the teaching of computer ethics issues, such as the power of the Internet, ethical issues of Internet conduct, law and security, to their students. The case study is presented in the form of a timeline of the newspaper coverage in order to convey the unfolding of the sequence of events. This presentation consists of three sections. Firstly we present the factual contents of the newspaper reports and secondly we identify the various stakeholders. Thirdly the ethical, social, and legal comments of these stakeholders are also discussed as we believe that this already suggests the misinformation created by the hoax email. Subsequently we analyze the case study from various perspectives. We take a closer look at the reported perceptions of the different stakeholders and we consider various aspects of appropriate ethical analyses. We also briefly investigate why the ethical and legal perspectives and conclusions turned out to be in conflict and finally conclude with a short discussion of some recent initiatives regarding computer ethics in SA.

First, debtors had to decide whom to trust, which was not only a cognitive problem about evidence but also a behavioral and practical problem involving risks.

Edmunds PhD, NP The widespread immunization of children in the 20th century for the prevention of common childhood illnesses is acclaimed as one of the greatest public health success stories. No longer do parents watch as child after child succumbs to the ravages of these diseases. One of the major reasons behind the decrease in childhood morbidity and mortality from these infectious diseases is the requirement for immunization as part of state-based school-entry requirements. While there is a great deal of success, there is also evidence of failure in achieving adequate child immunization rates. The best example is the recent epidemic of pertussis (whooping cough) in California. Pertussis is an endemic disease in the United States, with frequent outbreaks and periodic epidemics every 3 to 5 years. In 2010, 27,550 cases of pertussis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many more cases go unreported. As part of that number, 9,143 cases of pertussis (including 10 infant deaths) were reported throughout California. This is the highest number of cases reported in 63 years. Michigan and Ohio also have reported very high pertussis numbers over the past few years 1 Approximately 40% of reported pertussis cases are among children younger than 5 years old. In recent years, an increasing proportion of cases have been reported among adolescents and adults, and the number of outbreaks reported among school-age children and adolescents has been increasing. Infected adolescents and adults may introduce pertussis into households where susceptible preschool-age children and more vulnerable elders could be exposed.2 An article3 that examined the immunization status of American home-schooled children suggested that there are several reasons why children continue to be at risk for these preventable diseases: • Many current parents underappreciate the risks and severity of disease. • Some children go without immunizations until required when they enter school. • Clinicians may miss opportunities to immunize children because the child is ill. • Parental concern over possible vaccine adverse effects and safety and efficacy is fueled by anti-vaccine groups. • Parents claim exemptions from immunization for children because of religious or philosophical beliefs, freedom and individualism, misinformation about risk, and overperception of immunization risk. In fact, • 25% of parents in a survey believed falsely that their child’s immune system could become weakened as a result of too many immunizations. • Parents choose to withhold particular vaccines or lengthen intervals between doses. • Parents distrust the health care system. • As many as 2 million American children are schooled at home. Although mandatory immunizations are required for entry into public schools, state-based school-entry vaccination laws generally do not apply to home-schooled children. Little is known about the vaccination status of this population. There is a lot of false and misleading information that scares parents. Nurse practitioners (NPs) must be leaders in studying the scientific literature so they are accurately informed about the risks and benefits of immunizations.

This transmission of information represents an issue in our society, as can influence negatively the opinion of people about certain figures, groups or ideas. Hence, it is desirable to design a system that is able to detect and classify information as fake and categorize a source of information as trust worthy or not. Current systems experiment difficulties performing this task, as it is complicated to design an automatic procedure that can classify this information independent on the context. In this work, we propose a mechanism to detect fake news through a classifier based on weighted causal graphs.

In addition, white treaty commissioners frequently used misleading rhetoric or ignored issues entirely in order to postpone confrontations until such time as their governments chose to enforce a treaty.

En el siglo xxI mas que en ninguna otra epoca, la canalizacion y expresion apropiadas de las emociones en entornos laborales se ha convertido en un signo de inteligencia emocional, gran liderazgo e (inocuas) habilidades de persuasion. a pesar de ello, la persuasion se puede usar tambien para manipular las emociones de las personas. Meibauer (2018) explica que la mentira y el engano juegan un papel importante en los negocios y el comercio, lo cual es obviamente el caso del negocio de las noticias falsas (o mejor dicho, falseadas) o “fake news”. En este articulo investigamos el genero de las noticias falseadas a traves del analisis cualitativo sociopragmatico de ejemplos de este tipo de noticias en ingles, y mostramos como esta forma de periodismo apunta a la manipulacion de las emociones de los lectores, no solamente mediante mentiras prototipicas (es decir, aseveraciones cuyo contenido el hablante cree falso, pero que son producidas con la intencion de enganar al oyente), sino tambien y principalmente con estrategias pragmatico-discursivas complejas, tales como la manipulacion habil de los tres subsistemas evaluativos principales, acTITud, coMproMIso y graduacIon (Martin y White, 2005), la activacion de inferencias falaces o el uso de imagenes enganosas, jugando asi con la escalaridad de la mentira. Esto, a su vez, nos lleva a sacar conclusiones importantes que muestran que el hecho de que la expresion de lo falseado puede ser escalar tiene una conexion estrecha con los conceptos de “bullshit” (Frankfurt, 2005) y “posverdad” (Keyes, 2004): una buena historia que de alguna manera toque las emociones de los lectores, aun si es enganosa, prevalece sobre la historia verdadera porque los lectores eligen aceptar como verdadero aquello que apela a sus pasiones y, por tanto, los hace “sentir bien” EnglishEmotion is part and parcel of all kinds of human experience and as such plays an important role in all discourse types, including professional discourse. In the 21st century more than ever, the proper channeling and expression of our emotions at the workplace has come to be considered a sign of emotional intelligence, powerful leadership, and (harmless) persuasion skills. However, persuasion can also be used as a weapon to lie and manipulate people’s emotions. Meibauer (2018) notes that lying and deception play an important role in business and trade, and this is obviously the case in the business of fake news. In this article we analyze the genre of fake news within professional journalistic discourse. We carry out a qualitative sociopragmatic analysis of samples of political and scientific fake news in English, and show how this kind of journalism aims at manipulating readers’ emotions not only through the use of prototypical lies (i.e. assertions whose content the speaker believes to be false, uttered with the intention of deceiving the hearer), but mainly by means of complex discourse-pragmatic strategies such as the skillful manipulation of the three chief evaluative subsystems, aTTITudE, EngagEMEnT and graduaTIon (Martin & White, 2005), the triggering of false inferences and the display of misleading images, thus playing with the scalarity of lying. This in turn leads us to some important conclusions showing that the fact that the linguistic expression of falsity can be scalar is intimately connected with the concepts of “bullshit” (Frankfurt, 2005) and “post-truth” (Keyes, 2004): a good story that somehow touches readers’ emotions, even if it is deceiving, prevails over a true story, because the readers choose to accept as true what makes them “feel good”', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3005488180, 'A Study on fake news prediction using machine learning approach', 'Aayushi Priya ', 2019, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2162231294, 'Crime and Racial Constructions: Cultural Misinformation about African Americans in Media and Academia:', 'Nancy Wang Yuen ', 2011, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3008373232, 'Detecting Fake News Articles', 'Jun Lin (Louisiana State University), Glenna Tremblay-Taylor (Keene State College), Guanyi Mou (Worcester Polytechnic Institute), Di You (Worcester Polytechnic Institute), Kyumin Lee (Worcester Polytechnic Institute)', 2019, 0, 'Fake news has been generated and widely spread although journalists and researchers created fact-checking websites (e.g., Snopes and PolitiFact) and analyzed characteristics of fake news.

Single news consists of various multi-modal components (e.g., text, image, and event). Thus, a desirable model for fake news detection must satisfy two requirements: 1) it must correctly learn the reliability of each component 2) it must be capable of capturing the relationship among the components. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal Component Embedding framework (MCE) for fake news detection, which is designed to satisfy all the requirements. It first defines a latent vector for each news article as the sum of its component latent vectors. For each component, we regard its magnitude as its reliability, and regard its directional relationship as its consistency. In this context, the magnitude of each news latent vector represents how reliable the news is. Thus, MCE learns the latent space so that the magnitude of the real news vectors becomes larger than that of the fake news vectors. During the training, a news vector becomes larger when its component vectors are reliable (i.e., large magnitude) and when its component vectors are well aligned (i.e., high consistency). By doing so, MCE can capture the complex relationship among the components as well as the reliability of each component. Our extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that MCE outperforms all the baselines. We also provide a qualitative analysis on the embedding space to verify its capability of satisfying the requirements.', 0.0, 0, 0.13684210526315801, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (3008291922, 'A Location Independent Machine Learning Approach for Early Fake News Detection', 'Haohui Liu (Raffles Institution)', 2019, 0, 'The spread of fake news on the internet is presenting increasing threats to national security, with the potential to incite public unrest and violence.

Traditionally, to counter false belief a competing cascade approach is used. This approach assumes that the opposite belief is already known, and thus, not applicable to newly spreading fake news. Another approach is to block nodes and links of the network to impede the flow of fake news (rumor/influence blocking). However, a more active way to battle the dissemination of fake news is to propagate the corresponding real news, since people who receive the real news in tandem with the fake news are less likely to believe in fake news. Such a setting is especially useful on a messaging platform such as WhatsApp, where the news item flows as a private message and the correction of fake news and its propagation must be performed by the users within the network as they receive it. To achieve this goal, we propose network-based recruitment for active fake news correction (RecANt) to find a set of individuals of a pre-defined size to be incentivized for actively fact-checking and passing on the real news so as to reach the maximum number of nodes in the network. These individuals should be such that they are likely to receive the fake news so that they can test its credibility, and when they propagate the corresponding real news, it reaches a large number of individuals. We prove that RecANt is NP-Hard with a monotone and submodular objective, leading to a polynomial time greedy algorithm (AFC) which provides a (1 – 1/e – ϵ)-approximation. We further optimize the runtime of AFC by developing a fast graph-pruning heuristic (RAFC) that performs as well as AFC in checking the spread of fake news while reducing the runtime significantly.

The first important case surfaced with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal and there have since been many speculations about the influence of fake-news, transmitted through social networks in several elections, such as those in USA, Brazil and Nigeria. Consequently, checking the veracity of news propagated through social networks has become indispensable, and this responsibility must be borne by the social networks firms; accordingly, they have begun developing and operating rigorous electronic verifying algorithms. This is a microscopic approach toward the fake-news problem, and can be complemented with a macroscopic approach using some compartmental models that are commonly employed in epidemiology and rumor propagation. Specifically, the Daley–Kendall (DK) model, which appears to be a realistic compartmental model in rumor spreading and viral marketing, is suitable to describe fake-news propagation and can be equipped with a veracity checking compartment of population.

Unbalanced English–Spanish bilinguals (N\xa0=\xa081) listened to a lecture in English (L1) or Spanish (L2), read notes in L1 or L2, and completed a forced-choice recognition test in the lecture language. Unlike prior studies with proficient bilinguals, unbalanced English-dominant participants showed greater recognition memory accuracy for material presented in English only than did material presented in Spanish only. English misinformation had a greater impact on memory for the Spanish lecture than vice versa. Most importantly, the modified misinformation paradigm is an effective tool to investigate academic misinformation effects and could be used in bilingual and monolingual research.

And do they last as long as true ones? This study investigated whether experimentally created false memories would persist for an extended period (one and a half years). A large number of subjects (N = 342) participated in a standard three-stage misinformation procedure (saw the event slides, read the narrations with misinformation, and then took the memory tests). The initial tests showed that misinformation led to a signiﬁcant amount of false memory. One and a half years later, the participants were tested again. About half of the misinformation false memory persisted, which was the same rate as for true memory. These results strongly suggest that brief exposure to misinformation can lead to long-term false memory and that the strength of memory trace was similar for true and false memories. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. INTRODUCTION Human memory is not perfect. True memory fades, whereas false memory appears (Brainerd & Reyna, 2005; Loftus, 2003). Much is known about the longevity of true (or verid- ical) memory (e.g. Ebbinghaus’ (1885/1964) classic ‘forget- ting curve’). Much less is known, however, about the longevity or persistence of false memories. How long do false memories last? What types of false memories persist and why? Intuitively, false memories that are recounted once in a while (e.g. repeatedly giving eyewitness accounts of an event with some false information) will last at least as long as they are being recounted. What about false memory that is induced brieﬂy in an experimental setting and is unlikely to be recounted? Answers to this question should be of great signiﬁcance to our understanding of the enduring power of false memories. Researchers have used several paradigms to study false memory [e.g. the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm (DRM), the misinformation paradigm]. For example, the misinformation paradigm includes three standard stages— experiencing an event, receiving misinformation about the event, and being tested for memory of the event (Loftus, 2003)—with some variations in the speciﬁc design of each stage (e.g. Bekerian & Bowers, 1983; McCloskey & Zaragoza, 1985). Studies have shown that the subjects’ memory of the original event was affected by the misinformation they received, and false memories were hence created (see Loftus, 2003 for a review). The nature of such false memories, how- ever, has been under much debate. Researchers have proposed various theories such as the source-monitoring framework, the activation-monitoring account, the fuzzy trace theory, and the distinctiveness heuristic (see Brainerd & Reyna, 2005 for a description of these theories). The source-monitoring frame- work, for example, proposed that the false memories occur because of misattribution or confusion of the sources of information. Based on the source-monitoring framework, we predicted that once the subjects misattributed the source of *Correspondence to: Elizabeth F.

Thus far, only a few studies have examined the long-term (>1 year) persistence of false memories created in experi- mental settings with the misinformation paradigm. More than a half century ago, Davis and Sinha (1950) conducted an experimental study of long-term false memory arising from misinformation. They asked the subjects to read a story and three days later showed the subjects a picture that purportedly depicted the story. One group of the subjects was shown a picture that included some information that was inconsistent with the original story. Of relevance to the current study, a total of 16 subjects (nine in the misinforma- tion group) were asked to recall the story after 1 year. Results showed that details from the misinformation picture ‘intruded’ into later recall of the story. Although limited in scale and rigor (a very small sample size after much attrition, only one story with limited measures, no control items, no statistical tests), this study presented initial empirical evi- dence that false memory induced by experimentally pre- sented misinformation can last for at least a year. Since then, three other studies have examined long-term (≥1 year) maintenance of false memories created by misin- formation in children. Huffman, Crossman, and Ceci (1997) explored whether source misattributions that had been reported in an earlier study (by Ceci, Huffman, Smith & Loftus, 1994) persisted over time. In the earlier study (Ceci et al., 1994), children had been asked to imagine a false event (e.g. riding a hot-air balloon). For the following 10 weeks, these children were interviewed weekly, during which they were asked to ‘think real hard’ about whether the events had occurred (no matter whether true or false) and try to ‘recollect’ them. At the end of these interviews (i.e. misinformation sessions), children assented to 22% of the false events. Two years later, Huffman et al. (1997) followed up 22 children (6–7 years old) from the original Ceci et al. (1994) study. Half of the children still assented to at least one of the false events, and on average, the children assented to 13% of all false events.

The problem formulation considers the competitive diffusion of misinformation and correct information. It also accounts for the uncertainty in identifying initial misinformation adopters. For competitive propagation with major-threshold activation, we propose a solution based on stochastic programming and provide an upper-bound in the presence of uncertainty. We propose an efficient Combat Seed Selection algorithm to tackle general-threshold activation, in which we define a measure, “effectiveness”, to evaluate the contribution of nodes to the fight against misinformation.

It is suggested that such incidents are singularly important moments because they simultaneously evidence the need for Prevent-type interventions, but also such interventions' apparent failures to stop such violence. A key theme for the article concerns how, situated in the contemporary information environment, a key strand of Prevent work conducted in the wake of terrorist violence involves managing the potential impacts of rumours, conspiracy theories and other disinformation.

Nowadays, automatic misinformation identification has drawn attention from academic and industrial communities. For an event on social media usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly based on global statistical features. However, information on social media is full of noisy and outliers, which should be alleviated. Moreover, most of microblogs about an event have little contribution to the identification of misinformation, where useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless information. Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for a reliable misinformation identification method. In this paper, we propose an Attention-based approach for Identification of Misinformation (AIM). Based on the attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with largest attention values for misinformation identification. The attention mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention is calculated based textual features of each microblog. Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event. To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series of experiments on the Weibo dataset and the Twitter dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed AIM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.', 0.0, 0, 0.00487804878048781, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2724657317, 'Misinformation and the creation of ‘alternative facts’ : an interrogation of two myths in Nigeria', 'Jideofor Adibe (Nasarawa State University)', 2017, 0, 'Misinformation is very prevalent in Nigeria – as it is in most low trust societies\xa0where the level of literacy is low.

Usually the explicit goal of those initiatives is to guide citizens\' choice identifying the "best", centres. However, these efforts rely either on simplistic approaches in comparing the clinical performance of individual hospitals or on inadequate quality indicators. Therefore, this information may easily misguide the general public. In this paper, in order to highlight the problems implied, we consider two recent cases of mass media reporting on hospitals\' quality. METHODS: Two recent cases of mass media reporting on cardiac surgery centres\' quality are considered: the BPAC study "Esiti a breve termine di interventi di by-pass coronarico nelle cardiochirurgie italiane" coordinated by the Italian Institute of Health, and the publication by the news magazine Panorama of the list of the "best" Italian cardiac surgery centres based on a reputational index. RESULTS: The first example points out the problems implied by presenting hospitals\' clinical performance through league tables. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, this study shows how the conclusions merely based on ranking--even when these are based on a sensible quality indicator--can be potentially misleading. As for the second case study, it is shown the inadequacy of the quality indicator (the reputation index) adopted.

A content analysis regarding a total of 21 institutional guides was conducted. The major findings include the following: 1) in the librarians' guides stating their definition of fake news, the two elements of falsity and the intention to mislead were explicitly stated. The other element of bias, however, was presented in only some guides. 2) The sub-elements of clickbait, a decontextualized content and omitted information were inconsistently or barely presented across these guides. 3) Only two institutional libraries put forth the notion of fact in relation to fake news in their guides. 4) All of the guides suggested checklist approaches to detecting fake news or evaluating news sources. Finally, 5) librarians acknowledge the influence of human biases on consuming news. However, psychological factors are minimally presented in most of the guides. This study provides a few suggestions. First, librarians must further clarify the term fake news so that it reflects its multiple layers. Second, librarians must incorporate new strategies, such as lateral reading and click restraints, in combination with a few prioritized elements of a checklist into their guides regarding detecting fake news. Finally, librarians must pay attention to psychological factors more when interpreting facts in their strategies about news sources and fake news.", 0.0, 0, 0.0394088669950739, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (3040830373, 'Framing Fake News: Misinformation and the ACRL Framework', 'Allison Faix , Amy Fyn ', 2020, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3041011043, 'A Sensitive Stylistic Approach to Identify Fake News on Social Networking', 'Nicollas R. de Oliveira (Federal Fluminense University), Dianne S.

In this work, we focus on propagation-based fake news detection, as recent studies have demonstrated that fake news and real news spread differently online. Specifically, considering the capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dealing with non-Euclidean data, we use GNNs to differentiate between the propagation patterns of fake and real news on social media. In particular, we concentrate on two questions: (1) Without relying on any text information, e.g., tweet content, replies and user descriptions, how accurately can GNNs identify fake news? Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and avoiding the dependence on text-based features can make the model less susceptible to the manipulation of advanced fake news fabricators. (2) How to deal with new, unseen data? In other words, how does a GNN trained on a given dataset perform on a new and potentially vastly different dataset? If it achieves unsatisfactory performance, how do we solve the problem without re-training the model on the entire data from scratch, which would become prohibitively expensive in practice as the data volumes grow? We study the above questions on two datasets with thousands of labelled news, and our results show that: (1) GNNs can indeed achieve comparable or superior performance without any text information to state-of-the-art methods. (2) GNNs trained on a given dataset may perform poorly on new, unseen data, and direct incremental training cannot solve the problem.

But on the other hand, it is becoming a daunting task to differentiate between false information and true information thus leading to widespread fake news. We can define fake news as a type of deceiving journalism and statements that are used to artifice and mislead people. Also, the credibility of social media platforms is at stake where this news is mostly shared. These types of forged information news can have serious negative societal impacts and thus their detection has become the emerging area that is attracting research attention. In this paper, we propose a model for detecting fake news by examining the accuracy of a report and predicting its authenticity. By feature extraction and forming credibility scores from the textual information, this model builds an ensemble network to learn the portrayals of news reports, authors, and titles simultaneously. Different machine learning algorithms like SVM, CNN, LSTM, KNN, and Naive Bayes are used for higher accuracy and it was observed that LSTM showed better accuracy with 97%.

Libraries and other information-intensive organizations have long faced the problem of large collections of records growing incrementally. With the computerized records in a networked environment has come the recognition that duplicate records pose a threat to effective information retrieval. Yet what constitutes a match may be neither exact nor duplicate. Levels of discernment are required to permit matches on records that do not differ significantly and those which do. Initial Definitions What is matching? For this discussion, matching is the process by which additions to a large database are screened and compared with existing database records. Ideally this insures that duplicates are not added, nor erroneous replacements made of records pairs that are not really equivalent. A detailed review of the literature in this area is beyond the scope of this paper, but sources such as O'Neill, Rogers, and Oskins, (1993) and Hickey (1979) are good overviews of the problems of identifying duplicates and the implications for matching software. Which database? This project took place at OCLC Online Computer Library Center Inc., a nonprofit organization serving member libraries and related institutions throughout the world. OCLC's Extended WorldCat (XWC) is the database. It is the chief database capital of the organization, and it is 'owned' in a sense by the member libraries worldwide that use and contribute to it. At this writing it contains some 58 million records. What are the database contents? Individual records in XWC are complex bibliographic representations of physical or virtual objects--books, films, URLs, maps, slides, and much more. The records use the MARC communications format (Library of Congress, 2002). For example a record for a book might typically contain such fields for author, title, publisher, date, but many more in addition. The representation of any one object can be quite complex, containing scores of fields and subfields. Such a record may be brief, or several thousand characters long. The depth and richness of the records varies enormously. Why is matching a challenge? Does it not sound simple for computer software to compare records one to one and detect if they are identical? Perhaps so, but this is not the task of matching. Determination of what constitutes a match, under what conditions, involves a complex process of knowledge elicitation, requirements gathering, and even experimentation. Deliberating on sameness and difference in specific cases was not a trivial task. Two records describing the same intellectual creation or work (e.g. Shakespeare's Othello) can vary by physical form and other attributes. Two records describing both the same work and exactly the same form can differ from each other if the records were created under different rules of record description (cataloging). Two records intended to describe the same object can vary unintentionally if typographical or other entry errors are present in one or both. Thus sorting out significant from insignificant changes was a major task in developing requirements for the design of the software. This paper discusses the problems of matching encountered in the Metadata Capture Project at OCLC Online Computer Center. Metadata Capture is essentially the new implementation of a system for processing incoming records received from institutions, once pre-processed records by the existing infrastructure, and deciding which are already in the database. Matching decisions can result in adds or replaces of records in the database, or merely flags set to indicate library holdings. Tens of millions of records are processed through the existing record loading system every year. The task of Metadata Capture Project was to redesign the system software for interaction with the new Extended WorldCat database. Matching was one of the chief subprojects in the two year venture. …", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (221310690, 'The Dangers of the Dissemination of Misinformation in Implementing the Responsibility to Protect', 'Cherine Foty (Associate in International Arbitration and Litigation, Paris)', 2015, 0, 'The creation of the responsibility to protect doctrine reformulated the historical notion of humanitarian intervention.

This role has in the past been held by news agencies primarily, but this role is increasingly adopted also by private people and among them, also some who do not necessarily adhere the high standards of good journalism or scientific ethics. These give rise to fake news, spreading as unconfirmed rumors and possibly causing dramatic impacts to a society.

Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 139 pp. $44.95 hbk. $16.95 pbk. The image of our political and social system, which shapes our reactions to our government and our society, is based on an illusion. That\'s according to Murray Edelman in his book The Politics of Misinformation. In this book, Edelman argues that real social change and progress do not occur as often as we think they do. Instead, what occurs is an illusion of political progress and social change presented to us by media, corporate, and political elites. We are willing to accept these illusions because, as Edelman argues, we are willing to "vest power in a small group of people by accepting their right to rule and obeying their laws and orders, even when these are contrary to the interests of the great majority." The implication of accepting what we are told is that true social change; change that "substantially improves conditions for the mass of the population," is rare in our society. And according to Edelman, the reason true social change does not happen is because elites resist any change that would reduce their power, status, and financial resources. After presenting these basic arguments, Edelman attempts to show how our images are developed and maintained through the use of authority, public opinion, institutions, language, and science. In his final chapter, Edelman uses crime as an example to show how elites keep up the appearance that something is being done about crime, when, according to Edelman, the truth is that minorities and the poor suffer because of crime policies and the middle class is pacified by the appearance that something is being done to rid the society of crime. The strength of this book is Edelman\'s willingness to call into question how our institutions, our beliefs, and our society are based on a valuing of something that is good for elites but not for mass publics and certainly not good for minorities or marginalized groups. Edelman argues that our institutions, particularly our media, are part of this socialization that teaches us not to question why certain people have power and others do not, not to question class biases, not to question behavior by elites or public officials as long as the behavior is done on behalf of the state. Edelman rightly argues that many complex issues are so simplified by media and authorities that the public sees something like cri urinal behavior as primarily a problem of a person\'s individual behavior and rarely as an issue that might include broader social problems. The public rarely gets information in some broader context or historical framework, which may focus our thinking on a superficial solution to an immediate problem. The best parts of the book are Edelman\'s careful and astute observations about how we as a public are susceptible to accepting official versions of the truth or reality, when in fact we should become much more aggressive and critical about what we read, hear, or see. And he is accurate in many of his arguments about the groups that have been hurt by some of these portrayals: the poor, the disenfranchised, people without a voice in politics or in business.

The Internet’s power to disseminate information has helped the public in many ways. Yet this ability has simultaneously allowed for novel conflicts of interest—as when information misleads in order to promote a pharmaceutical company’s marketing efforts, and unduly influences physicians’ prescribing. These tensions are further complicated by the idiosyncrasies of the Internet as a communication medium, challenging traditional conceptions of medical ethical principles meant to safeguard the physician-patient relationship.\r\nObjective: We analyze how the Internet has influenced prescribing practices, and how its characteristics, coupled with the nature of contemporary medical practice, can leave both patients and physicians vulnerable to misinformation.\r\nMethods: A literature review was conducted to determine how the Internet may influence prescribing practices, and how its characteristics, coupled with the nature of contemporary medical practice, might leave both patients and physicians vulnerable to misinformation. \r\nResults: We found that drug marketing can mislead across both established and novel Internet domains, including search engines, company websites, e-mail lists, blogs, wikis, health information services, and mobile health software. We identify misleading Internet informational and presentational trends common among these domains and explore potential improvements.\r\nConclusions: Industry avowals against unduly influencing Internet users have proven insufficient. In a climate of resource-limited marketing regulation and time-strapped physicians, there is a need for third-party intervention and regulation. Such action implies finding a balance between protecting physicians' and patients' rights to unbiased health information, and respecting corporations' rights to freely promote their interests. We explore possible solutions. A means of identifying bias and veiled risk data in Internet pharmaceutical information is necessary. We suggest four ways in which access to unbiased health information can be improved online. 1) Pharma-independent evaluation systems such as HONcode could be improved with increased funding and FDA support. 2) The FDA or other regulatory agencies could require commercial websites and advertisements to prominently feature hyperlinks to unbiased treatment algorithms. 3) Search engine architects and purveyors might consider warning users that hyperlinks to unevaluated drug marketing sites may contain misinformation. 4) Finally, a number of “red flag” heuristics could identify misleading pharmaceutical search engine results. Using these heuristics, a search engine algorithm could reorder the presentation of results to reflect weighting of biased material. This would allow unbiased information to rise to the top of a search engine results page, where users are most likely to see it. This poster conceptualizes the basic principles of such an algorithm.

They give the Internet user the opportunity to play an active role, e.g., one can relay certain information via a blog, a comment, or even a vote. The Internet user has the possibility to share any content at any time. However, some malicious Internet users take advantage of this freedom to share fake news to manipulate or mislead an audience, to invade the privacy of others, and also to harm certain institutions. Fake news seeks to resemble traditional media to establish its credibility with the public. Its seriousness pushes the public to share them. As a result, fake news can spread quickly. This fake news can cause enormous difficulties for users and institutions. Several authors have proposed systems to detect fake news in social networks using crowd signals through the process of crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, these authors do not use the expertise of the crowd and the expertise of a third party in an associative way to make decisions. Crowds are useful in indicating whether or not a story should be fact-checked. This work proposes a new method of binary aggregation of opinions of the crowd and the knowledge of a third-party expert. The aggregator is based on majority voting on the crowd side and weighted averaging on the third-party side. An experimentation has been conducted on 25 posts and 50 voters. A quantitative comparison with the majority vote model reveals that our aggregation model provides slightly better results due to weights assigned to accredited users.

Moreover, there is a general agreement that the main vehicle of fakes news are malicious software robots (bots) that automatically interact with human users. In previous work we have considered the problem of tagging human users in Online Social Networks as credulous users. Specifically, we have considered credulous those users with relatively high number of bot friends when compared to total number of their social friends. We consider this group of users worth of attention because they might have a higher exposure to malicious activities and they may contribute to the spreading of fake information by sharing dubious content. In this work, starting from a dataset of fake news, we investigate the behaviour and the degree of involvement of credulous users in fake news diffusion.

Taking this into consideration, this paper intends to focus on the metaphorical occurrence in diverse semiotic modes that constitute multimodal texts. In order to fulfill this aim, we outlined a corpus of five editorial cartoons about “fake news”. Our specific objective is to, making use of the concept of multimodal metaphors proposed by Forceville (1996, 2009), presented how the different semiotic modes, in this case the verbal and the visual ones, are interwoven in the building of these metaphors. In this way, in our study, besides validating the thesis proposed by Forceville (2009) about the occurrence of metaphors not only in the verbal mode, it was also possible to verify the importance of multimodal metaphors for the meaning construction process in the analyzed genre.

Resumo: Ha quase quarenta anos atras um marco nos estudos da Linguistica Cognitiva, em especial em sua semântica, ocorreu: a proposta da Teoria da Metafora Conceitual. A partir desse trabalho, muitas pesquisas foram desenvolvidas em torno da categoria analitica da metafora. Porem, grande parte desses trabalhos ainda encontra-se no campo dos denominados textos monomodais, visando apenas a construcao conceitual resultante de dominios fonte e alvo oriundos especificamente do modo verbal. Diante disso, o presente artigo propoe-se a promover um trabalho dedicado a ocorrencia metaforica nos diferentes modos semioticos que constituem os textos multimodais. Para cumprirmos tal objetivo, delineamos como corpus cinco charges que versam sobre o conceito fake news. Nosso objetivo especifico consiste em apresentar, atraves do conceito de metaforas multimodais, proposto por Forceville (1996, 2009), a forma pela qual diferentes modos semioticos, nesse caso em especial o verbal e o imagetico, imbricaram-se na construcao dessas metaforas. Assim, em nosso estudo, alem de vislumbrarmos a validacao da proposicao de Forceville (2009) sobre a nao ocorrencia do processo metaforico apenas no modo verbal, foi possivel a verificacao da importância das metaforas multimodais para a construcao dos sentidos do genero em analise.

Our results suggest that the digital contagion of emotions, in particular anger, should be comprehensively considered in profiling the spread of online information. Cures such as tagging anger in social media could be implemented to slow or prevent the contagion of fake news at the source.', 0.0, 0, 0.0258823529411765, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (2074378597, 'Press: HIV misinformation', 'Gavin Yamey ', 2000, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3019207821, 'Testing and unpacking the effects of digital fake news: on presidential candidate evaluations and voter support', 'Rodolfo Leyva , Charlie Beckett ', 2020, 0, 'There is growing worldwide concern that the rampant spread of digital fake news (DFN) via new media technologies is detrimentally impacting Democratic elections.

Sinclair ', 1986, 0, 'by ANNA SOFAER and ROLF M. SINCLAIR The Solstice Project, P. 0. Box 9619, Washington, D.C. 20016/National Science Foundation, Washington, D.C. 20550, U.S.A. 7 v 86 Reyman (CA 27:155) accuses Marshack of "perpetuating misinformation" by referring (CA 26:537-39) to our archaeoastronomical studies of the three-slab site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. At this prehistoric site three rock slabs form light-and-shadow patterns on two carved spirals. Distinctive patterns on the spirals mark the solstices and equinoxes (Sofaer, Zinser, and Sinclair 1979) and lunar extremes (Sofaer, Sinclair, and Doggett 1982). On the same butte there are seven other markings of the solstices and equinoxes coupled with indications of midday (Sofaer and Sinclair 1984, n.d.). Reyman claims that "subsequent studies ... have disproved the originai conclusions of Sofaer and her colleagues." This is not borne out by the evidence he cites. Of his six references, two are his own earlier versions of the same accusations (Reyman 1980, 1985). The next two (Carlson 1983, 1984) are consecutive publications of a review of our general-interest film describing our work; although offering criticism, this review refutes specifically neither our theses nor our data. The next reference (Zeilik 1985) has been shown to contain serious errors, including miscalculations and misuse of references (Sofaer and Sinclair 1986). The authors of the last reference (Newman, Mark, and Vivian 1982) have since modified their conclusions to allow for the possibility of the conclusions of Sofaer et al. (Simon 1982). In addition, Reyman\'s comments and references ignore our subsequent discoveries (Sofaer and Sinclair 1984, n.d.) of further nearby sites that reinforce the conclusions reached in our earlier work. In summary, an inspection of Reyman\'s references shows that they have not "disproved [our] original conclusions" or "dispute[d] many of the basic data." At most they have advanced alternative interpretations of only some of the data. As a further criticism of our work, Reyman states that "spirals are not solar motifs per se." He does not mention that we have never claimed them to be such or that such an assumption is not central to our thesis. The ethnographic studies of the historic (post-A.D. 1900) Pueblo cultures he cites as evidence cannot be taken as exclusive guides to prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000) Pueblo usages because of the well-documented isruptions that characterized the intervening millennium (see, for example, Berry 1982, Cordell 1984, Upham 1984). As far as the precision of the Fajada seasonal markings is concerned, we do not claim anything not self-evident in the data we reported. We have demonstrated the existence of seasonally varying light patterns on petroglyphs that emphasize the extremes and midpoints of basic solar and lunar cycles. We agree with Reyman that the particular carvings on Fajada Butte (like other rock art) cannot be dated absolutely; our assignment of these astronomically involved petroglyphs to one phase of the Chaco culture is perforce inferential, as we have already made clear in an earlier response (Sofaer, Zinser, and Sinclair 1980). This assignment, however, is based on strong analogies in the archaeological record of that time and place as well as with underlying themes of the historic tradition (Sofaer et al. 1979, Sofaer and Sinclair n.d.).

Meanwhile, people were motivated to share news mainly because of their civil obligation to inform others and provide advice or warning. These motivations, together with other contextual reasons such as media control, interpersonal trust and youth unemployment, had led to fake news proliferation in Nigeria.\r\nMethodology: This study adopts a documentary research method to generate the information necessary to investigate fake news spread in Nigeria. A total of 265 articles were drawn from Google Scholar search and after a close examination, only 20 articles were included for analysis.\r\nImplications: There is a need to increase fake news awareness, media and information literacy among Nigerians.

At present, the post-truth, which means any fact that is interpreted in that system of values that you already know and are already familiar with, is taking an increasing share in the information space. Post-truth means circumstances in which objective facts have less influence on the formation of public opinion than emotions or personal beliefs. In this space, the subject is vulnerable to targeted informational impact, and his cognitive activity is redirected under the influence of the environment. In fact, from the point of view of information processes, the subject is not even in the world of post-truth, but in the world of fake news, which is beginning to crowd out healthy information resources. A semantic model of such an information space is proposed, which allows one to record the occurrence of a channel of potential undesirable effects.

Compulsory vaccination against smallpox, and chlorination of water supplies as a protection against typhoid fever-completely accepted today as commonsense preventive medicine -raised storms of protest from the ignorant and easily misled when they were first introduced. During the last decade we have witnessed the emotional rejection of water fluoridation for dental health in many communities, although dentists and physicians and other public health workers almost unanimously advocate it. In hundreds of communities, including my own, citizens have been so influenced by the half-truths and distortions of the opposition that they have allowed their children to be deprived of the benefits of this advance in our knowledge of dental health. The same hysteria and unfounded apprehensions are common in the nutrition field. They can be allayed by marshalling scientific data and getting it to the public through public health education. Our task has been to bring documented truths about food and nutrition to the average person in a form he can understand and accept. This need remains, even though many professional organizations and agencies are hard at work in the nutrition education field. To emphasize the point that the magnitude and nature of this continuing problem is such that it demands coordination of the various educational programs now being carried out if they are to be effective in combating it, I would like to mention briefly some of the major sources of nutrition misinformation that manage to remain active despite efforts to the contrary. Emotions about food, and long-standing food habits, set up a strong and persistent barrier to the assimilation of factual advice. The average person shows a solid aversion to making any change in a habit he finds pleasant, and the joys of eating are particularly pleasant.

It presents a detailed and comprehensive classification of analytical centers and shows how they have been developing historically and politically since the 20th century. The author pays attention to the problem of independence of academic and political expertise in the times of information wars, digital illiteracy and dissemination of fake news. In addition, the author compares Russian and Western think tanks, reveals their main differences, systematizes their problems and proposes several original ways of resolving these challenges facing the academic community both in Russia and the U.S. today. The article’s relevance is explained with the fact that today nobody, even experts and academics, are immune to fake news and “disruptive technologies”, with their ideas and expertise frequently taken out of context and used in the goal of manipulation, as exemplified by the case of The Brookings Institution and The Atlantic Council in February 2017. Moreover, the lack of demand of academic expertise in political circles during Donald Trump’s presidency, the plight of Russia Studies programs and International Relations schools in the U.S. as well as partisanship within think tanks only aggravate the problem of today’s ideas industry. But all this makes this article more timely and relevant. Its novelty adds up to the fact that the author uses the systemic and comprehensive approach to resolve the problems of Russian and American think tanks in the era of fake news and digital technologies. In particular, it is offered to focus on the roots of the problems (not their implications) by diversifying and streamlining the sources of think tanks funding, turning “disruptive technologies” into new opportunities and creative tools to restore credibility of political and academic expertise, make it better, more effective, educative, objective and independent.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2956147826, 'Sentiment Aware Fake News Detection on Online Social Networks (Forthcoming)', 'Oluwaseun Ajao (Sheffield Hallam University), Deepayan Bhowmik (University of Stirling), Shahrzad Zargari (Sheffield Hallam University)', 2019, 0, '', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2763670854, 'User disinformation and opportunity for nursing', 'Ana Cristina de Oliveira Abraão Santesso (Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora), Denise Barbosa de Castro Friedrich ', 2017, 0, 'ABSTRACT Objective : to analyze the immediate repercussions of the educational action of the nurse performed in the waiting room of hemodynamics, aimed at patients and caregivers, before a procedure of cardiovascular intervention.

Emerging from this conversation has been a number of proposals that seek to pass legislation or promulgate regulations that would make it more difficult for disinformation to flow through the web. \r\nTo that end, these interventions will confront the long-standing legal protections provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA 230), a key legal provision which broadly shields platforms from legal liability for the actions of third-party users of their services. For the past two decades, this provision has been seen as major driver in the growth of online services, and a cornerstone supporting free expression on the web. Simultaneously, CDA 230 has also been argued to inhibit platform responsiveness to the harms posed by harassment, defamation, sex trafficking, and a host of other activities online. The present-day debates on how to address "fake news" will join the legacy of efforts to reform or eliminate the shield provided by CDA 230. \r\nThis paper seeks to address three questions given this historical background.

Through text analysis of user comments corpora on nearly 2,100 political posts from popular sources in Facebook, we found that compared to true news, political disinformation received significantly less analytic responses from Facebook followers. While the results indicated greater anxiety in responses to true news, responses to political disinformation were filled with greater anger and incivility. We also found similar (low) levels of cognitive thinking in responses to extreme conservative and extreme liberal disinformation. Contrary to prior research findings, our results indicated that responses to extreme liberal disinformation in Facebook were filled with greater anger and incivility.

Nowhere was this more evident than during the 2016 United States Presidential Election. Although the current of disinformation spread via trolls, bots, and hyperpartisan media outlets likely reinforced existing biases rather than sway undecided voters, the effects of this deluge of disinformation are by no means trivial. The consequences range in severity from an overall distrust in news media, to an ill-informed citizenry, and in extreme cases, provocation of violent action.

The findings of this study are increasingly important because of the proliferation of social media news stories and the exposure of organizational stakeholders and business decision makers to a tremendous amount of information, including information that is not correct (a.k.a. disinformation).,The data were collected utilizing the snowball sampling methodology. Students in an Management Information Systems course completed the survey. Since a diverse sample was sought, survey participants were instructed to recruit another individual from a different generation. The survey questions of the FFM identify particular personality traits in respondents. Survey respondents were given a collection of nine news stories, five of which were false and four that were true. The number of correctly identified stories was recorded, and the effect of personality traits on the ability of survey respondents to identify fake news was calculated using eta-squared and the effect size index.,Each of the five factors in the FFM demonstrated an effect on an individual’s ability to detect disinformation. In fact, every single variable studied had at least a small effect size index, with one exception: gender, which had basically no effect. Therefore, each variable studied (with the exception of gender) explained a portion of the variability in the number of correctly identified false news stories. Specifically, this quantitative research demonstrates that individuals with the following personality traits are better able to identify disinformation: closed to experience or cautious, introverted, disagreeable or unsympathetic, unconscientious or undirected and emotionally stable.,There is scant research on an individual’s ability to detect false news stories, although some research has been conducted on the ability to detect phishing (a type of social engineering attack to obtain funds or personal information from the person being deceived).

We show that in order to leverage users' flags efficiently, it is crucial to learn about users' flagging accuracy. We develop a novel algorithm, DETECTIVE, that performs Bayesian inference for detecting fake news and jointly learns about users' flagging accuracy over time. Our algorithm employs posterior sampling to actively trade off exploitation (selecting news that maximize the objective value at a given epoch) and exploration (selecting news that maximize the value of information towards learning about users' flagging accuracy). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via extensive experiments and show the power of leveraging community signals for fake news detection.", 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3000593858, 'When is Disinformation (In)Credible?

In Media Mythmakers: How Journalists, Activists, and Advertisers Mislead Us, Benjamin Radford writes like the reincarnation of Howard Beale. He chastises journalists for not fulfilling their role in a democracy, that of providing information to the citizenry, but also spreads the blame to others who misuse the media, such as well-meaning activists, public relations people, and politicians. The managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer, Radford is also coauthor of the book Hoaxes, Myths, and Manias: Why We Need Critical Thinking. Radford begins by taking aim at the advertising industry for its misuse and abuse of the English language. For example, he asks how a product can be both new and improved, how a bottle of 100 percent juice can contain other ingredients, and how homemade ice cream can be manufactured in a factory. The use of nonsense terms such as lighthearted for a snack mix is one reason why, he says, "informed choice is hard to come by when many product labels are meaningless, misleading, or both." Radford is also concerned about the blurring of lines between news and advertisement, such as newspaper advertisements that are designed to look like news copy, and publications such as the Journal of Longevity, which is not a peer-reviewed, research-based journal but basically a promotion for health supplements. He warns of the symbiosis between news and advertising when the news creates exaggerated fears, such as the dangers of everyday bacteria, and then unnecessary products are sold to deal with the fear, such as anti-bacterial soaps. The balance of his book swings to a focus on the news media, beginning with an explanation of news bias, but not in the usual liberal-conservative dichotomy. Instead, it refers to bias in the news gathering process, which includes sensationalism, predefining news events, and selective news coverage. As an example, Radford notes coverage of crime, which would probably lead most people to believe that homicide is more common in this country than suicide, when the opposite is true. In terms of predefining the news, he notes that after 9/11, few news stories included people who, although sad, were managing to cope and go on with their lives. One result of this misdirected news-gathering is that "when we misplace our fears, we run the very real risk of wasting time and resources on insignificant problems." The perception that the crime rate is high and exploding has led to increased spending on prisons. Stories on road rage shift the focus from the more significant problem of drunk driving. There are also criticisms of sensationalizing news, to the point that when something important does happen it is difficult to put it into perspective, and the unnecessary emphasis on emotions, rather than on facts. Radford rails against politicians who hype various dangers and then proclaim a way to solve the problem and well-meaning people who use the news media to promote their social agendas. As an example, he cites problems created by Megan\'s Law, which requires police to notify the local community of a convicted offender\'s move into a neighborhood. In addition to the challenge of the law\'s constitutionality, problems include violation of double jeopardy, hindering police investigation by putting police on the wrong track, and vigilantism, to name a few. Media monopolies are another threat to responsible journalism. Newsrooms are reluctant to criticize the corporations with which they are tied; people without journalistic backgrounds are making news decisions.

Thus, media has the power to create the social identity. The person of present days is the victim of stress, of a busy and strained life and that is why he tries to find relaxation, entertainment to forget his daily worries for a couple of hours. Television takes great advantage of this and offers its public the entertainment it requires. But, behind these things there are hidden the real intentions of those who guide and impose constraints by means of mass media: manipulation and misinformation.A first step towards being listened to is exordium, defined1 as the first part of a discourse which, by statement, tries to get the attention and good will of the audience. Trying to convince, when there is some distance between the speaker and the audience, implies to shape your argumentation to be able to create a linking bridge. Philippe Breton, university professor at the Centre for Journalism of the University in Strasbourg, is of the opinion that quite often to be convinced is not an answer to an initial request. «Exordium is, to an equal extent, a means to create such a request, to make it seem legitimate. In this way, the public is given good reasons to expect the sequel»2Once attention is caught, the intention of manipulation could have a greater chance to be successful. According to Oxford Dictionary of Politics, published at Oxford University Press in 2009, manipulation is influencing a person, a group of people or a situation in order to obtain some advantage or changing an opinion or belief in an indirect, incorrect, dishonest way, it could be made in an intelligent and scrupulously way. This often implies propaganda especially when it has in view more than one person. A manipulator will use arguments in which he does not believe, he denies or distort relevant information or "plays" with the mind of a person by means of emotions.In the Dictionary of Sociology, coordinated by Catalin Zamfir and Lazar Vlasceanu, edited by Babel publishing house in Bucharest in 1998, manipulation is defined as an action in which a social actor is made to think and act according to the initiator\'s own interests and not according to his interests by persuasion techniques which distort deliberately the truth, giving the impression of freedom of thinking and freedom of taking a decision.Unlike the influence exerted by rational conviction, manipulation does not intend to create a correct and profound understanding of a situation; it aims at breaking a convenient understanding. Thus, misleading occurs by using false arguments making use of emotional non-rational elements. In all this time, the real intentions of the person transmitting the message remain undetected by the receiver of the message.Herman Parret, PhD in phylosophy at the Lueven University in Belgium, in the book Prolegomenes a la theorie de l\'enonciationa. De Husserl a la pragmatique, published in Berne in 1987, introduces six primary forms of manipulation action:1. Manipulation caused by the contact between the world of objects and manual action, representing the initial sense of the manipulation act.2. Manipulation resulting from the interaction between the physical action and the world of beliefs, the physical constraint to change an option or a belief.3. Manipulation determined by the interaction between the physical action and the world of actions, a change of action imposed by a physical action.4. Manipulation resulting from the impact between the discursive action and the world of objects, when ideas about nature, works of art could be changed.5. Manipulation resulting from the interaction between the discursive action and the world of beliefs - the media discourse or that of preachers can change beliefs.6.

Applying this approach, FND problem has been considered as an optimization problem for the first time and two metaheuristic algorithms, the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) have been adapted to the FND problem for the first time as well. The proposed FND approach consists of three stages. The first stage is data preprocessing. The second stage is adapting GWO and SSO for construction of a novel FND model. The last stage consists of using proposed FND model for testing. The proposed approach has been evaluated using three different real-world datasets.

This can be used to defame people by putting them in unfavorable situations or the other way around as propaganda by making them appear more important. In addition, montages may have been altered with noise and other manipulations to make an automatic recognition more difficult. In order to take action against such montages and still detect them automated, a concept based on feature detection is developed. Furthermore, an indexing of the features is carried out by means of a nearest neighbor algorithm in order to be able to quickly compare a high number of images.

An important goal in improving the trustworthiness of information in online social networks is to identify the fake news timely. However, fake news detection remains to be a challenge, primarily because the content is crafted to resemble the truth in order to deceive readers, and without fact-checking or additional information, it is often hard to determine veracity by text analysis alone. In this paper, we first proposed multi-level convolutional neural network (MCNN), which introduced the local convolutional features as well as the global semantics features, to effectively capture semantic information from article texts which can be used to classify the news as fake or not. We then employed a method of calculating the weight of sensitive words (TFW), which has shown their stronger importance with their fake or true labels. Finally, we develop MCNN-TFW, a multiple-level convolutional neural network-based fake news detection system, which is combined to perform fake news detection in that MCNN extracts article representation and WS calculates the weight of sensitive words for each news.

Newsweek called her “the HIV disbeliever.” In her book, What if Everything You Knew About AIDS Was Wrong?, she explains that HIV tests are unreliable, pregnant women who are HIV-positive cannot transmit the virus to their babies, and AIDS is not a global health problem. Maggiore was 1 of the “HIV dissenters” invited to meet the South African president Thabo Mbeki at this year's 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa. Act Up San Francisco recently took up her cause, inviting her to a public meeting to discuss “the truth” about AIDS in Africa.\r\n\r\nThis was no ordinary meeting. Outside the hall, activists wandered around in T-shirts that declared “Warning! This area is being patrolled by Act Up.” They handed out leaflets saying, “Don't Buy the HIV Lie.” The group is famous for its direct-action activities, and wherever they go, they inspire the feeling that something unsettling is about to happen.\r\n\r\nMaggiore proved to be an eloquent and calm spokesperson. Although her views may be extreme and often untenable, she does not come across as an extremist when she recounts her own experiences. She described that in 1992, doctors told her that she was HIV-positive. She had another test that was indeterminate, then a negative test, and finally another positive test. This uncertainty led her to question the scientific knowledge about the virus and the disease, and she then set up Alive & Well AIDS Alternatives, a nonprofit organization “founded by HIV-positives who have learned to live in wellness without AIDS drugs and without fear of AIDS.” Her personal choice is perhaps understandable, if unconventional.\r\n\r\nBut when she started to talk about Africa, her beliefs began to sound increasingly bizarre. HIV disease is not a problem in Africa, she explained, and the figures for the number of infected people are simply false. The sick and dying people she saw in the hospitals could not have had AIDS. “Poverty,” she said, “malnutrition, and lack of access to basic medical care were causing the devastation and disease.”\r\n\r\nAt this point, Maggiore's partner, a film director, showed the audience a film he made when he accompanied her to Durban. We hear a South African journalist saying, “I'm scared for Africa and where it might go. The only hope is Thabo Mbeki.” We see a young HIV-positive man who has stopped all of his antiretroviral medication. “I don't have fear,” he says. “Fear is a terrible emotion.”\r\n\r\nIt is hard to make sense of all this HIV disbelief, but these 2 voices in the film give some clues. AIDS has been a catastrophic illness, decimating the gay communities in San Francisco and Sydney, Australia, and now is ravaging the developing world. The United Nations estimates that 1 in 2 teenagers in Africa will develop the disease. How is it possible to deal with this appalling phenomenon? Perhaps by denying that there is a problem at all. Boston college psychology professor Joseph Tecce, who has studied AIDS dissenters, told Newsweek: “The basis of denial is a need to escape something that is terribly uncomfortable. If something is horrific, I might want to pretend it doesn't exist.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of the meeting, Maggiore took questions from the audience, and the atmosphere turned confrontational. One man screamed at her to “read MEDLINE” for the wealth of evidence about HIV and its treatment. Another explained that his HIV-positive friends had responded well to combination therapy and that they had no intention of throwing away their drugs.\r\n\r\nThe international scientific and medical community has made it clear what it thinks of dissidents like Maggiore. More than 5,000 scientists have now signed the Durban Declaration (http://www.durbandeclaration.org), which states: “The evidence that AIDS is caused by HIV-1 or HIV-2 is clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous. This evidence meets the highest standards of science.” The signatories say, “It is unfortunate that a few vocal people continue to deny the evidence. This position will cost countless lives.”\r\n\r\nOther HIV activists in the United States and the developing world, including Nobel Prize winners Doctors Without Borders, are similarly outraged by the dissidents. These activists are campaigning for the fundamental right of people in poor countries to have access to HIV medicines. When Maggiore says that poverty is killing Africa, this, they believe, is only a half-truth. Lack of medicines is equally as deadly. The activists publicized their anger at a rally in Durban, carrying placards that read, “One Dissenter, One Bullet.”\r\n\r\nThe 4 rebel Act Up groups want people to reexamine the orthodox view of AIDS. But if this leads to people abandoning the use of safe sex, have they really done the world a service? The number of new HIV cases in San Francisco has risen recently, so people cannot afford to be complacent. Maggiore's mantra, uttered again and again at the Act Up meeting, is that “you have a choice” in whether to take treatment.

The dramatic voice-over commentary by the station\'s long-time Jerusalem correspondent, Charles Enderlin, described how the boy and his father Jamal were pinned down by Israeli gunfire at Netzarim Junction in the Gaza Strip. The father pleaded frantically with the soldiers to stop shooting, to no avail. "A last burst of gunfire," intoned Enderlin, "the boy is dead, his father critically wounded." The bloodless images of Jamal and Muhammad al-Dura were instantly seared into the public mind. Distributed free of charge to international media, repeated endlessly like a raucous war cry, the Dura video provoked anti-Jewish violence in Israel and, on a scale not seen since the Holocaust, throughout Europe. 1 The recently-created al-Jazeera television-founded in 1996-was significantly boosted by exploiting the Dura death scene. Recognized almost immediately as a staged scene by astute observers, denounced by others as an unfounded accusation against Israeli soldiers, the Dura video has been analyzed, investigated, dissected, exposed, taken to court, attacked, defended, exploited, and debated for almost ten years.2 As it turned out, the Palestinian cameraman Talal Abu Rahma, who has won countless prizes for the video, captured less than one minute of the dramatic scene that lasted, according to his sworn testimony, for forty-five minutes. Forty-five minutes of uninterrupted gunfire "from the Israeli position" left the man and boy miraculously intact as far as one can gather from looking at the video. Contrary to what the world has been led to believe, there is no raw footage of the scene. And, contrary to what might be expected, this and other equally embarrassing revelations have left the Dura myth, to all intents and purposes, intact. REINVENTING A LIE In his latest attempt t0 silence critics of the controversial broadcast, Enderlin recently published a book-length defense of the original allegations, Un Enfant est mort (A Child is Dead), followed by the dateline Netzarim, 30 septembre 2000? Systematically presented in France as an internationally acclaimed expert on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the France 2 correspondent is virtually unknown in the rest of the world, except perhaps for his role as producer of the "Death of Muhammad al-Dura." Enderlin likes to scold critics of the broadcast by saying they have never set foot in Gaza and know nothing about war reporting. In spring 2011, riled by complaints in "communitarian" (i.e., Jewish) media about the failure of national media and, more particularly, the state-owned France 2 TV channel, to cover the blood-curdling slaughter of five members of the Fogel family in the Itamar settlement on March 12, 201 1, the professional journalist treated critics to a lecture on his blog on how a newscast is composed. "I wish I could report all important events," he wrote, "the horrible Itamar crime, the tragic death of Palestinian adolescents killed last year by an Israeli strike on Gaza (. . . for which Benjamin Netanyahu apologized), rockets that fall regularly in the south of Israel." A news director, explained Enderlin with a touch of exasperation, must allocate limited air time to a flow of incoming news. Priorities are set according to "well-established criteria." With thousands dead from earthquake and tsunami in Japan, "the world\'s third largest economy," there was no room to cover "what happened in Itamar." The next day, he added, a short item was squeezed in on the consequences of the murder (i.e., anticipated settler violence). Until the culprits were arrested, opined the seasoned journalist, the attack could not be qualified as a terrorist assault.4 No such doubts about the identity of the culprits had tempered Enderlin\'s enthusiasm for the Dura video, aired within a few hours after its filming. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (186290077, 'The Perennial Pleasures of the Hoax', 'James Fredal ', 2014, 0, 'Though popular in the nineteenth century and widespread since, the elements of the hoax form can be traced to the origins of rhetorical theorizing, principally in the strategies of probability and counterprobability developed by the early orators and sophists.

DoughtyOutside observers commenting on American domestic policy are at a tremendous disadvantage. Various domains of public policy, but especially the enormously important and expensive fields of health care and education, attract organizations and attitudes which it is difficult for outsiders to understand. The large role played by private sector institutions from Health Maintenance Organizations (which manage health care for millions) to giant publishing houses and associated information technology firms (which dominate the textbook industry and thereby public school curricula) are just two of the businesses that exert extraordinary control over areas that most advanced countries think are properly administered in the public domain.Even (or especially) the language is different. Fringe elements in American politics and in the print and broadcast media make patently outrageous claims about, for example, President Obama\'s political views. Some, for instance, claim that the president is a "socialist," thus proving only that they have no idea what a socialist (democratic or revolutionary) is. What\'s more, bizarre claims including the questions of the president\'s birth place or religious affiliation are made with apparent impunity and with brazen disregard for the facts. Moreover, even the mainstream media feel compelled to take such matters seriously and to feature quasi-debates on them. After all, it makes for dramatic theatre, but it increasingly seems like theatre of the absurd.Now that the USA seems to have tired of Middle Eastern military adventures for the time being, the issues about which Americans argue seem mainly to be domestic and the issue of health insurance has preoccupied the electorate for at least the past year. Education, however, is never far from the spotlight and may soon come forward as being at least as important and as highly contested. Diane Ravitch has been at the centre of the controversy over schools for decades.Reign of Error is the best way to educate yourself about the takeover of our educational system by billionaires who, even if they are well-intentioned, do not understand what they are doing. - Paul Horton, History Teacher - Chicago.Ms. Ravitch is an educational historian who has spent a great part of her professional life in and around government.

Bush, and appointed to the National Assessment Governing Board under President Clinton-a position she retained through the first administration of President George W. Bush.Originally a supporter of the President George W. Bush\'s "No Child Left Behind" program, Ravitch became increasingly disillusioned with the direction American education was taking and took the path of apostasy. She has now become as one of the most competent, coherent and severe critics of what might best be described as neoliberal or, perhaps, corporate education.The main arguments brought against the existing public school system are pressed by an impressive range of celebrities, politicians and manufacturers and merchants of educational technology.

This new environment facilitated a leveling factor that brought people from all parts of the country and from all walks of life. These people transplanted their beliefs, attitudes, and values into their new surroundings. Not surprisingly, the first structures built in these new Illinois settlements were churches, schools, and meeting places, most times well before the installation of merchants and tradesmen.1 Entering into these newly established settlements were the effects of religious revivalism originating in the East and New England. The most important group emerging from this movement was the Mormons, or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS). Led by the charismatic Joseph Smith, the Mormons emerged from the millennialist groups of the second Great Awakening to establish themselves as a large and fast-growing religious sect. Smith\'s message and the Mormon religious doctrine were based upon the Book of Mormon, Smith\'s own translation of metallic tablets, or plates, said to contain the history of the ancient inhabitants of North America. These ancient plates were said to be made of gold and were presented to Smith by the angel Moroni. After the Mormons moved from the New York area to Kirtland, Ohio, and to Missouri, they ran into public resentment and violence, forcing them into exile in Illinois. The Mormons later fully established themselves and their church at Commerce, Hancock County, Illinois in 1839. Commerce, later renamed Nauvoo, soon grew to be one of the largest settlements in the state. The influence and effects of the Mormons soon spread to other areas of the state through their extensive missionary work and pamphlets. The spread of Mormon influence in west-central Illinois in the early 1840s left most people divided into one of two camps. One either fell on the pro-Mormon side or the anti-Mormon side. As tensions in Hancock County grew, the aftershocks reverberated throughout the state. Rumors spread of polygamy and theft on the anti-Mormon side. Having become familiar with Mormon doctrine and traditions by the pamphlets spread by nearby Mormon churches as well as the information passing through the small village, three citizens of Kinderhook, in western Pike County, Illinois, set plans in motion to expose the Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith as a fraud. Bridge Whitten, Robert Wiley, and Wilburn Fugate planned their own version of the Mormon myth. The three entered Whitten\'s blacksmith shop where they created their own plates from brass and planted them in a local Indian mound. After doing so, the three hoped to plan a "discovery" and circulate their story in hopes of attracting Smith\'s attention. They then hoped to fool Smith into releasing some statement concerning the authenticity of the plates in order to expose him as a fraud. While their very intentional and well-planned hoax did not achieve its original goal, it did have a huge effect on the church for quite some time. The confusion surrounding the murder of Smith and the subsequent immigration of the church to Utah caused the hoax to remain unaddressed by Smith. The fact that Smith had never officially commented as to whether or not the plates were authentic led many members of the church to take the plates at face value and never question their authenticity. Whether Smith accepted the plates or not is conjecture, but the church and its establishment defended the plates until 1981. This position has provided a source of controversy for the church ever since. The fact that the Kinderhook Plates, an admitted hoax, was defended by many important members of the church for over one hundred years has created a major discrepancy in the chronological history of the church.

We designed four different prototypical patients with a combination of common COVID-19 symptoms and opportunities for exposure who were made to self-assess using the 10 provincial COVID-19 self-assessment tools on 1 April. These tools were developed to allow individuals to self-triage, allowing health systems direct capacity to testing and care. We assessed the consistency of the self-assessment tools and of the guidance provided to the patients. While the tools generally screen in three areas, the scope of included COVID-19 associated symptoms as well as the opportunities for exposure, and therefore transmission, vary between provinces such that no two provinces screened in the same way. This was, in turn, reflected in the inconsistency in guidance found. A patient with cough who had travelled abroad or had close contact with a confirmed case within 14 days received the most consistent guidance, with remaining patients receiving guidance ranging from mandatory quarantine or self-isolation to being told they did not have COVID-19 symptoms, guidance at odds with medical evidence. Thus, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. Without consistency in public health guidance, Canadians cannot appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, nor can the necessary valid and reliable data be collected to inform critical epidemiological models that help guide pandemic response.

INTRODUCTION The purpose of this Note is to analyze whether members of the Internet media may face liability under section 10(b)1 and Rule lOb-52 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for their participation in the Emulex3 stock hoax. Although the media acted with sufficient recklessness, the media will probably not face liability under section 10(b) and Rule lOb-5 because of heightened pleading standards for securities litigation and wellestablished protective First Amendment policies developed in defamation case law. This Note recommends ways in which various market actors can modify their behavior in order to minimize the risk of future market manipulation. Additionally, this Note considers whether the courts may impose a "duty to readership"4 on the media. II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION On August 24, 2000, shares of Emulex closed at $113.06.5 That same afternoon, 23year-old Mark Simeon Jakob sent a fabricated press release via e-mail to his former employer, Los Angeles-based Internet Wire, Inc.,6 reporting that the SEC was investigating Emulex, that profits were to be restated, and that CEO Paul Folino had resigned.7 Jakob sent the false press release using an unauthorized e-mail account from El Camino Community College, where he was formerly enrolled as a student. 8 As a former employee of Internet Wire, Jakob allegedly knew that the Internet Wire night shift would be "typically short-handed" such that he could "fast-talk his way around standard fact checks."9 Jakob\'s press release, described as "clumsily worded," contradicted recent news that Emulex\'s revenues had doubled and earnings were up 150%.10 Nonetheless, Internet Wire issued the unconfirmed information at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) and the news quickly spread over the Internet.II Reputable news sources, including TheStreet.com, CNBC, Bloomberg, and the Dow Jones Newswire also picked up the story. 12 Jakob\'s plan was well-timed. Employees at Emulex had not even arrived at the office before the stock price plummeted, causing NASDAQ13 to halt trading at 10:30 a.m. EST, with share prices hovering around $65.14 Despite the devastating hoax, Emulex has recovered from the fraud and has not made plans to file a lawsuit.15 Michael E. Smith, Emulex\'s vice president, stated, "[w]e quickly refocused on the business. It\'s done and past."16 Nearly one month after the hoax, Emulex shares were trading at $172.19.17 Jakob will not be able to refocus on his life for some time. FBI agents apprehended him just five days after perpetrating the hoax. 18 On August 31, 2000, the SEC charged Jakob with securities fraud and wire fraud.19 His profit from the hoax amounted to approximately $240,000,20 which pales in comparison to Emulex\'s $2 billion market value loss.21 Worse yet, reports estimate that investors collectively lost almost $50 million in the hoax.22 Very few Emulex trades transacted during the hoax were block trades.23 Consequently, mostly individual traders, not institutional investors, fell victim to the fraud.24 This victimization of individual investors is disheartening to those who participate in the burgeoning practice of on-line trading and rely on the Internet for relevant news affecting their portfolios. The Internet has become a "highly accessible" source for stock market information.25 The Emulex hoax demonstrates that even reputable Internet news sources can be the tools of a market manipulator like Jakob. A. The Efficient Market Hypothesis One version of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), the "semi-strong" version, "posits that at any given time, share prices in an efficient market will incorporate all publicly available information relating to publicly traded companies."26 Of course, an important assumption underlying the EMH is that investors act rationally in response to disseminated information. One commentator argues that the Emulex hoax should "affirm our faith in the market" because Emulex\'s stock price reacted so quickly on the false news release. …', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (3044601409, 'Upholding Scientific Duty Amidst Poisonous Disinformation', 'Daniel A.

Materials and Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was planned by enrolling 240 patients attending tertiary care teaching hospital. Total consecutive sampling technique was chosen to recruit the patients for the study. Tools Tools used were case reporting form and components of primary care index (CPCI). Results The results show statistically significant association between chronic history of illness of patient (P = 0.02), education of patient (P = 0.008), and habitat of patient (P = 0.05) with interpersonal communication between patient and physician, and the results also show statistically significant association between accumulated knowledge (P = 0.000), coordination of care (P = 0.001), continuity belief (P = 0.000), comprehensiveness of care (P = 0.001), and first contact (P = 0.001) with interpersonal communication between patient and physician.

Public engagement by scientists, clinicians and patient advocates can contribute towards public understanding of medicine. However, depth of feeling on many issues (notably vaccination and cancer) can lead to adverse reactions for those communicating medical science, including vexatious interactions and targeted campaigns. Our objective in this work is to establish a taxonomy of common negative experiences encountered by those communicating medical science, and suggest guidelines so that they may be circumvented. Design We establish a taxonomy of the common negative experiences reported by those communicating medical science, informed by surveying medical science communicators with public platforms. Participants 142 prominent medical science communicators (defined as having >1000 Twitter followers and experience communicating medical science on social and traditional media platforms) were invited to take part in a survey, with 101 responses. Results 101 responses were analysed. Most participants experienced abusive behaviour (91.9%), including persistent harassment (69.3%) and physical violence and intimidation (5.9%).

Harley (pictured in this editorial) about his new book, Fake News and Dinosaurs, and I am pleased to publish it below.\r\n1. What compelled you to write a picture book about fake news? Is your book the first of its kind for young readers?\r\n\xa0JH: The main motivation behind Fake News and Dinosaurs was the lack of resources about media literacy aimed at young people. Advertising, sure, but not evaluating information and news. This was particularly striking for me given how young people are now when they begin to interact with the Internet and associated devices. I found myself wondering what resources I could provide to some of my pre-service teachers (i.e., future elementary and high school teachers) in a course I taught at the U of A that covered media literacy. When I couldn’t find anything that would speak to young readers about fake news and media literacy—even with help from the Head Librarian of the Faculty of Education, Katherine Koch, back in the summer of 2017, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands. By which I mean, I also roped my partner and professional illustrator, Daniel Beaudin, in to helping.\r\n2. One of the key messages in the book is “just because all your friends agree with you doesn’t mean that you’re right” (44). Do you think young readers are learning enough about ideological echo chambers from their teachers or parents? Are you hopeful that more will be done to educate young people about the importance of fact-checking?\r\n\xa0JH: The lack of books available for young people suggest that we need to do more. Providing resources is an important starting point. As it stands, many adults are also struggling with concepts such as echo chambers and biases. We hope our book appeals to both audiences so that teachers and parents can also identify teachable moments to bring these concepts up outside of planned lessons and talks. Media literacy and associated skills are practical ones and important to practice in order to cultivate. By helping teachers, parents, and peers become more familiar with good practices, such as fact-checking, skills can more easily become habit. And good media literacy habits are the best inoculation against fake news.\r\n3. The character named Gill is described as “a gossipy neighbor and farmer” (11) who is shown to spread misinformation, and readers clearly see how distorted information can spread very quickly. Gill’s behaviour certainly gives one the impression that gossip has considerable potential to be harmful to others. Is there such a thing as “good gossip”? If so, what would you like your readers to understand about it?\r\n\xa0JH: Gossip is typically characterized as being a less-than-reliable source of information. If there is a good side to gossip, it is the social component: an enjoyment of sharing information with other people. Communication with others is, in a broad sense, a generally healthy tendency—just like eating. But like eating, how “healthy” communicating might be (for oneself and others) often depends on what is being shared, under what conditions, and to whom. Media literacy provides a toolset to help foster a healthier exchange of information. In Fake News and Dinosaurs, Gill reminded us that false information isn’t always spread by malicious people, nor is it always spread through the web.\r\n4. At what age do you think children are capable of becoming fact checkers? What can adults do to help the young people in their lives become better at fact checking?\r\n\xa0JH: Checking facts can start with something as simple as looking for the name of an author or remembering where something came from. These lower-hanging fruits are strategies young people can start practicing relatively quickly. As they mature, so can the strategies they use. For example, rather than just looking to see if an author’s name is present, they might also reflect on what the author’s affiliations and credentials are and the role that these might play in helping them discern the credibility of a particular story.\r\n5. Do you think young readers have heard or read that we are living in a “post-truth age”? How does your book handle this topic, if at all?\xa0\r\n\xa0JH: One of the decisions Daniel and I made in creating Fake News and Dinosaurs was to use what is called a “secondary world”. In our book, this meant a world populated by dinosaurs rather than humans. Following the adventures of two young Troodons rather than humans was both more fun (we love dinosaurs) but also stands to help readers focus on the story and lessons it imparts without getting weighed down with associations with contemporary issues. We hope this helps make the book accessible and friendly to as wide an audience as possible—and help avoid it falling into an echo chamber.\r\n6. How do you think your book will help young readers to be less vulnerable to the lure of fake stories?\xa0\r\n\xa0JH: Research has shown that narrative (story) is a powerful way to teach. We hope that learning about media literacy with concrete but fun examples embedded in a dino mystery story will help young (and old!) readers remember, recognize, and appropriately respond to fake news.\r\n7. Do you have any other book projects in mind for the future?\xa0\r\n\xa0JH: We are currently working on a French translation of Fake News and Dinosaurs.\r\n8. Do you encourage readers to get in touch with you?\r\n\xa0JH: We are always happy to hear what readers think of our book through social media @JasonHarley07 and @DanielBeaudin3. Neither of us, however, are full-time writers/creators and both of us have demanding careers, so we are not typically able to respond to specific questions via social media (or otherwise), unfortunately.\xa0 We do attend some writing conventions such as CanCon, however, and would be delighted to chat there (or at academic conferences)!\r\n\xa0\r\nLinks to get the book:\xa0\r\nFake News and Dinosaurs: The Hunt for Truth Using Media Literacy\xa0is\xa0available through\xa0Indigo-Chapters,\xa0Barnes & Noble,\xa0Amazon, and\xa0Friesen Press.\xa0\r\nLinks to prior interviews:\xa0\r\nLinks to media interviews about the book:\xa0Global News\xa0and the\xa0Toronto\xa0and\xa0Edmonton Star\xa0papers', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2979242825, 'The Four Facebooks: Misinformation, manipulation, dependency, distraction', 'Nolen Gertz ', 2019, 0, 'A postphenomenological analysis of Facebook, revealing the four ways that users can interact with Facebook, and the dangers this represents.', 0.0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (2980267532, 'Analysis and Detection of Health-Related Misinformation on Chinese Social Media', 'Yue Liu (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), Ke Yu (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), Xiaofei Wu (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), Linbo Qing (Sichuan University), Yonghong Peng (University of Sunderland)', 2019, 0, "With the mobile Internet development, e-health has become increasingly connected with people's daily life.

Here I used Twitter and blended learning technologies to create a research partnership with farmers based on their beliefs that earthworms indicate good soils management. Through co-design, farmers transformed this symbol into a systematic field observation network, assessing earthworm populations to the ecological group level. Our community (#WorldWormWeek) revealed the falsehoods in misinformation such as: “Farmers around the world have been turning their fields into subterranean deserts”. This social learning network was resilient to further misinformation by the national press. Real data trends were fundamentally different to predictions made by science advancing models of global earthworm populations. Anecic earthworms (including middens) were absent in 1 in 5 fields, directly informing management practices to avoid soil biological pitfalls in no-tillage adoption. Simplistic earthworm counts to indicate soil health are rendered obsolete, a depth of information exchange can be achieved by building science-farmer partnerships using digital communications and co-designed frameworks.

In the considered model, each IoBT node seeks to counter the misinformation attack by finding the optimal probability of accepting given information that minimizes its cost at each time instant. The cost is expressed in terms of the quality of information received as well as the infection cost. The problem is formulated as a mean-field game with multiclass agents, which is suitable to model a massive heterogeneous IoBT system. For this game, the mean-field equilibrium is characterized, and an algorithm based on the forward backward sweep method is proposed to find the mean-field equilibrium. Then, the finite-IoBT case is considered, and the conditions of convergence of the equilibria in the finite case to the mean-field equilibrium are presented. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a 1.2-fold increase in the quality of information compared with a baseline scheme, in which the IoBT nodes are always transmitting.

This positions smart assistants as potentially useful modalities for retrieving health-related information; however, the accuracy of smart assistant responses lacks rigorous evaluation. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the levels of accuracy, misinformation, and sentiment in smart assistant responses to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination-related questions. METHODS We systematically examined responses to questions about the HPV vaccine from the following four most popular smart assistants: Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Microsoft Cortana. One team member posed 10 questions to each smart assistant and recorded all queries and responses. Two raters independently coded all responses (κ=0.85). We then assessed differences among the smart assistants in terms of response accuracy, presence of misinformation, and sentiment regarding the HPV vaccine. RESULTS A total of 103 responses were obtained from the 10 questions posed across the smart assistants. Google Assistant data were excluded owing to nonresponse. Over half (n=63, 61%) of the responses of the remaining three smart assistants were accurate. We found statistically significant differences across the smart assistants (N=103, χ22=7.807, P=.02), with Cortana yielding the greatest proportion of misinformation. Siri yielded the greatest proportion of accurate responses (n=26, 72%), whereas Cortana yielded the lowest proportion of accurate responses (n=33, 54%). Most response sentiments across smart assistants were positive (n=65, 64%) or neutral (n=18, 18%), but Cortana's responses yielded the largest proportion of negative sentiment (n=7, 12%). CONCLUSIONS Smart assistants appear to be average-quality sources for HPV vaccination information, with Alexa responding most reliably.

METHODS Independent searches were conducted on the three most commonly accessed search engines (Google, Yahoo and Bing) using the keyword "scoliosis". The top 30 sites from each search engine were reviewed. Each website was categorized as per its authorship and sourcing. Each site was then evaluated for accuracy, readability and with quality-assurance markers such as Health on the Net code (HONcode), DISCERN, Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) systems. The accuracy of the website was assessed by two fellowship-trained spine specialists. Website accuracy was rated on a scale of 1-4 based on the level of agreement with the information presented. Websites with greater than 75% agreement were rated 4.\xa0Finally, the sites were evaluated with a validated website distraction index and assessed for mobile friendliness. RESULTS 42 unique websites were analyzed. 31% of the sites were categorized as academic (13 academic, 9 healthcare system, 12 health news outlets and 8 unspecified) and had the highest rate of physician authorship (54%). Accuracy ranged from less than 25% to more than 75% were recorded with a mean accuracy of 3 signifying 50-75% agreement. Academic sites had the highest scoliosis specific accuracy score (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Overall, average readability was at a 12th grade reading level. More than 90% of the sites were mobile friendly. Approximately 71% of the websites did not have HONcode certification, although health news outlets had the highest rate of certification (67%). There was a significant effect of HONcode certification on DISCERN, JAMA, grade level and reading ease. On average, HONcode certified websites had lower grade level readability with greater reading ease and higher DISCERN and JAMA scores than un-certified sites (p\u2009<\u20090.05). On average, health news outlets had the highest DISCERN, JAMA, and reading ease scores and were written at the lowest grade reading level but had the highest level of distraction (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION For the iGeneration and their care-givers, the internet remains the most popular source of health-related and medical information. Despite the wide number of sources available, the quality, accuracy, pertinence and intelligibility of the information remains highly variable.

Due to the private encrypted nature of the messages it is hard to track the dissemination of misinformation at scale. In this work, we propose an approach for WhatsApp to counter misinformation that does not rely on content moderation. The idea is based on on-device checking, where WhatsApp can detect when a user shares multimedia content which have been previously labeled as misinformation by fact-checkers, without violating the privacy of the users. We evaluate the potential of this strategy for combating misinformation using data collected from both fact-checking agencies and WhatsApp during recent elections in Brazil and India.

This as a result has led to global explosion of hate speech and fake news. Hate speech normally lead to tension and holds in it, the potential for national or even international crisis of untold proportions. It also has the likelihood to scare people away from expressing themselves for fear of hate-filled responses and becoming a source of fake news.

Results: Stronger agreement with misinformation beliefs was significantly associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and primarily speaking a language other than English at home (all p<0.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (p<0.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. The belief that the threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated increased between Wave 1-2 (p=0.002), while belief that herd immunity benefits were being covered up decreased (p<0.001).

Data were analyzed via the process of immersion/crystallization. A total of 24 breastfeeding women completed a roughly 40-min telephone interview. The mean age of the mother was 32\u2009±\u2009.88 and the mean age of the child being breastfed was 8.5\u2009±\u20091.4\u2009months old. Findings demonstrate mothers see value in engaging in physical activity primarily for reasons related to self-care. In addition, breastfeeding women have a lack of information and support regarding healthy eating and physical activity while breastfeeding and many are receiving misinformation through resources such as Facebook support groups. Finally, mothers want more resources available that focus specifically on healthy behaviors while breastfeeding. Women need greater access to education and resources regarding healthy eating and physical activity while breastfeeding.

Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. An online survey was used that targeted people aged 18 and above and residing in Jordan. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, male gender, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety and lower knowledge about the disease. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic.

The problem is to find a set of nodes that minimizes the impact of misinformation at an allowed cost when blocking them from the network. We prove that the problem is NP-hard and the time complexity of the objective function calculation is $\\#P$ -hard. We also prove that the objective function is monotone and submodular. We propose an approximation algorithm with approximation ratio $(1-1/\\sqrt {e})$ based on these attributes. For large networks, we propose an extended algorithm by using a tree data structure for quickly updating and calculating the objective function. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets show efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms.', 0.0, 0, 0.107954545454545, 2.1230530261547303e-05), (3012283937, 'NELA-GT-2019: A Large Multi-Labelled News Dataset for The Study of Misinformation in News Articles', 'Maurício Gruppi , Benjamin D.

We adopt the quantile regression method and use signal detection theory for the study period 2008 to 2018. Misinformation corrections significantly influence the buy- and sell-side trading of qualified foreign institutional investors (Qfii), investment trust companies (Trust), and dealers across quantiles. Misinformation corrections with identified sources have a significant negative influence on institutional investors' decision making across quantiles, whereas those without identified sources show mixed influences. Brief and long-length written clarifications have a significant positive influence on misinformation correction for decision making across quantiles, while those of mid-length have a contrary effect at low and mid quantiles. Misinformation correction in newspapers has a significant negative influence on decision making, but financial newspapers and other sources show the contrary. Multi-purpose newspapers negatively and significantly influence misinformation correction, whereas economic newspapers display insignificant influences. Investment and retained-earnings related clarifications, negatively and positively, significantly influence misinformation correction for decision making, respectively. While technology-related industries indicate positive information signaling and learning from other sources and retained-earnings related clarifications, their counterparts show the opposite from financial newspapers and investment related clarifications. This study identifies the influence of misinformation correction by relating source monitoring and textual analysis.

They are guided by religious and ideological reasons and refuse to immunize themselves and children. They argue that the obligation to vaccinate is a limitation of their human rights. The vaccination movement has been present in the social sphere since the 19th century, however after the publication of Andrew Wakefield’s article on the subject of the alleged connection between vaccination and autism – the movement became very popular and contributed to a significant increase in the number of unvaccinated children in some countries. Nowadays, in the cyberspace and mass communication, it seems that both medical and social sciences face new challenges related to the spread of the movement.

We analyzed the 3113 tweets that meet inclusion criteria using public health trained human coders to assess tweet characteristics (joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame, health context, Ebola specific messages, and rumors. We assessed the proportion of tweets with specific content using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests. Of non-joke tweets, 10% of Ebola-related tweets contained false or partially false information. Twenty-five percent were related to politics, 28% contained content that provoked reader response or promoted discord, 42% contained risk elevating messages and 72% were related to health. The most frequent rumor mentioned focused on government conspiracy. When comparing tweets with true information to tweets with misinformation, a greater percentage of tweets with misinformation were political in nature (36% vs 15%) and contained discord-inducing statements (45% vs 10%). Discord-inducing statements and political messages were both significantly more common in tweets containing misinformation compared with those without(p\u2009<\u20090.001). Results highlight the importance of anticipating politicization of disease outbreaks, and the need for policy makers and social media companies to build partnerships and develop response frameworks in advance of an event.

In this work, we are interested in exploring scenarios where the number of annotations is limited. In such scenarios, we investigate how tapping on a diverse number of resources that characterize a news article, henceforth referred to as "aspects" can compensate for the lack of labels. In particular, our contributions in this paper are twofold: 1) We propose the use of three different aspects: article content, context of social sharing behaviors, and host website/domain features, and 2) We introduce a principled tensor based embedding framework that combines all those aspects effectively.

Loftus (University of California, Irvine)', 2020, 0, 'Objective: Feedback from lineup administrators about identification accuracy significantly impacts witness confidence. In the current studies, we investigated the effect of post-identification feedback given 1-week after an initial, pristine lineup. We tested 2 kinds of feedback: typical feedback (i.e., about identification accuracy) and misinformation feedback. Misinformation feedback came in the form of suggestive questioning that falsely suggested the participant was either more or less confident in their initial identification than they actually reported. Hypotheses: We hypothesized both confirming misinformation and typical feedback would significantly inflate witness confidence relative to no feedback controls while disconfirming misinformation and typical feedback would deflate witness confidence relative to controls. Method: Across 2 studies, participants (N = 907), recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, watched a mock crime video, made an identification, and reported their confidence under unbiased lineup conditions. One week later, they received either confirming or disconfirming misinformation or typical feedback. They then provided a retrospective confidence judgment. Results: Misinformation feedback caused significant confidence change. Participants given false feedback that they were more confident in their initial identification than they reported later recalled greater initial confidence. Even when pristine identification conditions were used, typical confirming feedback caused participants to later remember greater confidence than they initially reported at the time of the lineup. Even in the absence of any feedback, control participants showed significant confidence inflation over time. Conclusion: These results highlight the need for lineup administrators to both ask for and document verbatim witness confidence at the time of the initial identification.

Yet, little research has provided in-depth analysis of real-world data to measure the extent to which Internet users engage with it. This article examines 6.5 million interactions generated by 500 posts on an emblematic case of online health misinformation: the Facebook page Sante + Mag, which generates five times more interactions than the combination of the five best-established French media outlets. Based on the literature on cultural evolution, we tested whether the presence of cognitive factors of attraction, that tap into evolved cognitive preferences, such as information related to sexuality, social relations, threat, disgust or negative emotions, could explain the success of Sante + Mag\'s posts. Drawing from media studies findings, we hypothesized that their popularity could be driven by Internet users\' desire to interact with their friends and family by sharing phatic posts (i.e. statements with no practical information fulfilling a social function such as "hello" or "sister, I love you"). We found that phatic posts were the strongest predictor of interactions, followed by posts with a positive emotional valence. While 50% of the posts were related to social relations, only 28% consisted of health misinformation. Despite its cognitive appeal, health misinformation was a negative predictor of interactions. Sexual content negatively predicted interactions and other factors of attraction such as disgust, threat or negative emotions did not predict interactions. These results strengthen the idea that Facebook is first and foremost a social network used by people to foster their social relations, not to spread online mis-information.
